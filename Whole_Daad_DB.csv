Applicants with Bachelor's degrees from foreign countries must submit their applications by 15 October of the previous year.,,No,No,"Students gain broad knowledge of design and construction through a combination of lecture series and modules that discuss design and construction in the areas of urban design, design of buildings in existing contexts and built environments, and design of new buildings. These topics are directly related to internationally oriented projects and a series of elective modules, giving students the chance to focus on their individual interests, which may then become the main focus of their Master’s theses. Moreover, 30 ECTS can be chosen from the German Master’s degree programme in “Design and Construction“ (“Entwurf und Konstruktion”).By intensively studying several contexts from a global, diversity-oriented, and multicultural point of view, students develop an ability to independently translate any abstract design into a concrete implementation of material and construction. They will be able to combine professional, practical, technical, economic, ecological, and social aspects while, at the same time, taking varied cultural, historical, and climatic situations into consideration.In the fourth semester, students write their Master’s theses.The modules complement each other and are linked to one another, for instance, through combined projects, excursions, lectures, conferences, and e-learning. The integrated, international structure of the degree course offers students the chance to have a unique study experience in the future-oriented metropolis of Frankfurt.Course objectivesThe study programme concentrates on the combination of design and construction. “Advanced Architecture“ means designing and constructing on all scales, from urban contexts to single details. Advanced, future-oriented concepts are developed and addressed in study projects and office internships as well as with the FFin (the Frankfurt University research institute) and in close collaboration with our cooperation partners from the construction sector.In particular, graduates will be able to work at the interface between abstract designs and their concrete implementations. This means a focus on the planning phase, referred to in the German Official Scale of Fees for Services by Architects and Engineers as “execution planning“, with strong feedback on the design process and in close connection with current developments of scientific research in design and construction.Relevant occupational fields of graduates are in architectural, engineering, and construction companies, the construction industry, property development and housing associations, real estate companies, and the public sector as well as the research and technological development of design and construction.","The full-time English Master’s degree programme in “Advanced Architecture. From Urban Design to Building Construction” lasts for four semesters and operates in close conjunction with the existing German Master’s degree programme in “Design and Construction"".

As a reaction to the ever-growing importance of computational methods for the modern civil engineer, the Faculty of Civil Engineering at RWTH Aachen University has developed the new specialisation Advanced Computational Methods in Civil Engineering (AdCom) for the Civil Engineering Master's degree programme. Taught completely in English, this specialisation lends itself not only to the tendencies of present-day engineering but also to the future of civil engineering. AdCom graduates are able to apply and develop numerical methods and simulations for the realisation of innovative civil engineering structures. The curriculum is interdisciplinary with courses from the faculties of Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics. This allows students to obtain a deeper understanding of the key skills in structural mechanics, fluid mechanics, and numerical mathematics.Students will learn to master challenges such as those which arise from the use of new resource-conserving materials and advanced composite materials as well as those that arise from the trend towards extremely light load-bearing structures. The development of state-of-the-art lightweight structures, which are subject to dynamic loads such as wind and traffic, will be just one of many expertises that our students possess. The knowledge and use of numerical methods, mechanical principles and the development of software code account for just a fraction of skills that make up our students' repertoire, which enables them to assess the strength and limits of numerical modelling in civil engineering.The curriculum of Advanced Computational Methods in Civil Engineering is highly scientific and research-oriented and thus prepares graduates for a PhD programme and ultimately a scientific career in research or in industry. To prepare students for such a future, a new research module and a scientific mini-thesis are a part of the curriculum in addition to the Master's thesis.Future opportunitiesThe Master's programme has a strong focus on research that is accompanied by an excellent international reputation. This is especially present in the second year, where students work side by side with university researchers, thus gaining unique insights and experience in modern scientific methodologies.Engineers with expertise in computational methods are multidisciplinarily trained professionals. They are able to pursue a successful career not only in academics but also in an industrial environment, which could range from classic civil engineering to the various areas of mechanical engineering.","The faculty of Civil Engineering offers a Master's programme with eight areas of specialisation.

Please apply directly to the KSTW:https://www.kstw.de/wohnen.You do not yet need a letter of admission in order to apply.The fierce competition on the private housing market has resulted in above-market rents – particularly in proximity of the city centre.

The team work project is focused on creation of your product idea following a human-centred design approach. A further topic is the introduction to programming.Module Two: System Architecture and Safety ConceptBased on the product idea, you and your team will create a system architecture and technical requirements. A special focus is on safety of your product. Basics in deep learning and V2X communication are also taught.Module Three: Sensors for Environmental Perception and Data FusionImplementation of your autonomous systems start on the side of perception. You will learn how to use and calibrate sensors, deepen your knowledge in artificial intelligence and get introduced to sensor fusion methods. All of this is directly applied in practice as part of the team work project.Module Four: Vehicle Connectivity and LocalisationAn autonomous system needs to know where it is in order to act properly. In this module, you will gain knowledge about localisation algorithms as well as methods for connecting vehicles. Simulation of traffic systems as well as statistics, advanced deep learning and introduction to vehicle dynamics complement the module.Module Five: Navigation and Virtual SafeguardingThe major topic of this module is the navigation of autonomous systems, including SLAM algorithms, path and trajectory planning as well as controller design. A second focus is on virtual safeguarding – you will learn how to test and validate you product using simulation. Additionally, you can specialise into one of your favourite topics by working on an appropriate side project.Module Six: System Test and Product LaunchIn the last module of the course, the goal is to finalise the system in order to show a complete demonstration of the use case. Of course, testing the product is a key challenge. Lectures about launching a product give you important additional insights.

It includes a variety of measures that aim at making Europe's largest economy free offossil fuels and nuclear energy. In order to attain this, all areas of energy production and consumption will have to go through a transition process. Besides mobility and industry, buildings are therefore one of the key factors for a successful Energiewende.Advantages and OpportunitiesThe programme has an orientation on practical implementation. Whereas building a house has become a manageable task, things become much more complicated when considering the urban environment and wider interests such as energy efficiency. Strategic concepts for communication and cooperation are crucial for success when dealing with large-scale projects.The Master’s degree programme in building sustainability focuses therefore not only on economic and technical perspectives but also aims at imparting basic knowledge in other relevant disciplines. This means that the scope of the programme is both broad and specific at the same time. The combination of technology, management, and sustainability-related topics is therefore a unique opportunity for young professionals to extend their skills.Graduates will be able to moderate and manage complex projects in the planning, construction, and real estate sectors. The programme provides the knowledge and skills for assessing projects from economic, ecological, and technical perspectives as well as for creatively, both in teams or independently, finding solutions considering various stakeholder interests. Graduates will be able to enter the labour market (private and public sectors) or continue on with postgraduate studies.EUREF CampusThe main study location is the European Energy Forum (EUREF), built around the historical Gasometer in Berlin-Schöneberg. The campus is the setting of an innovative community, which includes applied research, economic, and policy consultancies that are mainly based on the philosophy of sustainability. Students (who are the future building experts) study in close cooperation with leading enterprises and institutions located on the EUREF Campus. This enables students to also become acquainted with practical projects in the field of energy, sustainability, and management.","Programme ContentThe MBA programme “Building Sustainability in an Urban Future” comprisesskills, methods, and conceptsto consider different approaches and to understand and align these approaches in order to reachsustainable solutions. Such competencies are indispensable in every building, construction, and real estate project that takesenergy efficiencyand other sustainability criteria as balancing economic, social, ecological, and cultural aspects in responsibility for future generations into account.In this regard, students will learn a lot from experts and from each other. Students will hopefully enjoy the international, interdisciplinary teamwork as well as Berlin’s urban and cosmopolitan atmosphere.Module DescriptionThe Master’s degree programme is taught in English over a period of three semesters.The first semestercovers the technical, economic, entrepreneurial, and legal foundations for management decisions in the building sustainability sector.The second semesterdeepens this view through the interdisciplinary project, management, and lecture series modules.The third semesterbroadens this view while simultaneously focusing on practice according to each student's individual interests.All semestersinclude lectures, tutorials, and seminars as well as company visits and excursions, online materials related to practice, and extracurricular activities.The Master's thesisis due in the third semester and concludes the programme.First Semester:Technology (9 ECTS)Economics (6 ECTS)Business (9 ECTS)Law (6 ECTS)Second Semester:Management (12 ECTS)Lecture Series (6 ECTS)Interdisciplinary Project (12 ECTS)Third Semester:Elective 1 (6 ECTS)Elective 2 (6 ECTS)Master's Thesis (18 ECTS)PDF Download",,,,,No,No,The semester contribution (enrolment fee) amounts to 307.54 EUR per semester and isnotincluded in the tuition fees.

The increasing influx of people can make the search for adequate accommodation quite difficult. Dozens of apartment hunters often compete for one single apartment. This is why we strongly recommend that you start looking for a place to live as soon as possible.Cologne's most convenient and economical housing option is often a student dormitory. A public student services association called ""Kölner Studierendenwerk"" (KSTW) operates 88 student dorms offering roughly 4,800 rooms. The seemingly large number of dorm rooms is misleading; as the dormitories are open to the roughly 90,000 students enrolled at all Cologne universities, they are in extremely high demand. Please be aware that TH Köln does not allocate the rooms in these dorms. Please apply directly to the KSTW:https://www.kstw.de/wohnen.You do not yet need a letter of admission in order to apply.The fierce competition on the private housing market has resulted in above-market rents – particularly in proximity of the city centre.

Once accepted and enrolled, they can choose any one of the six majors.The Communications Engineering (COMM) major offers a broad range of topics covering the field of communication and information technology at different levels of abstraction.The system concept stands at the most abstract level: the parts and systems that are required for a specific communication task. For this, the necessary mathematical foundation will be laid. The architecture of the systems used, like transmitters, receivers or signal processors, will be covered in depth. The components of these will be discussed: digital signal processing including the VLSI implementation, analogue components like mixers, amplifiers and filters as well as antennas are all part of the Master's programme.Naturally, since the entire field of Communications Engineering is too vast to cover in two semesters worth of lectures, only the general ideas and principles will be taught in the mandatory “CORE” courses, while the students can choose from a broad catalogue of “ELECTIVE” subjects, effectively deciding the field they want to focus on.Core subjects are:Estimation and Detection TheoryMobile Radio Networks 1Principles and Design of Communication Systems and NetworksRF SystemsThe major COMM covers the whole range of communication: wireless communication, electromagnetic waves, optical communication and special forms such as radar or satellite navigation as well.Since the programme covers ideas and concepts behind communication and information engineering rather than only one type of communication technology, students will be able to apply these to any current or future communication system. They will be able to develop complex systems via a hardware/software co-design methodology. Furthermore, they will have all of the necessary skills to perform the modelling, analysis, synthesis, and optimisation of such systems. This ensures optimal job security in the future.On top of that, the institutes of the RWTH offer numerous research assistant positions.

Since then, design has been perceived as a cooperative discipline that synthesises diverse aspects of knowledge. Since autumn 2014 the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation and Anhalt University of Applied Sciences in cooperation with the transdisciplinary Cluster of Excellence ""Matters of Activity. Image Space Material"" at Humboldt University Berlin offer a Master's programme, which engages with the Bauhaus legacy in design research.The one-year Master's programme COOP Design Research offers an overview of the diversity of academic scholarship in this field and contributes to strengthening a research practice by the means provided by design. The programme strives to integrate design and research as a transdisciplinary field between material studies, social sciences, design anthropology, cultural studies, technology studies, architecture and design history, and theory. Throughout the programme, students obtain the academic knowledge and intellectual competencies to critically engage with the complex challenges designers face in the 21st century. In this respect, students acquire the ability to engage in an academic discourse, to theoretically penetrate phenomena of the material environment and to articulate themselves in writing. The students’ experiences gained in previous studies and professional practice constitute the basis for developing an approach towards a design research led by critical reflection. Comprehensive introductions to methodologies of theory reading, academic writing, field research, and analysis are provided as tools for complementing both theoretical knowledge and practical reflexivity. It is not only about what is studied, but it is also about how it is learned — due to its interdisciplinary and transcultural structure, the programme also promotes inclusion, diversity and critical thinking.The COOP Design Research MSc programme is conducted as a teaching cooperative by Anhalt University of Applied Sciences and the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation in cooperation with Humboldt University Berlin, with coursework taking place both at Gropius Bauhaus in Dessau and — to a lesser degree — at Humboldt University in Berlin. The diversity of the teaching staff with their different academic backgrounds contributes to the multiperspectivity of the programme. The courses are jointly run by professors and lecturers from the associated institutions as well as by international guest lecturers.Drawing from different teaching methods contributed by each of the three aforementioned partner institutions, the core of the MSc programme relies on three thematic building blocks: Design as Research, Design as Education, and Design as Projection.The Master of Science degree opens up professional perspectives in the fields of research and teaching of design, cultural studies, as well as curatorial practice. It can be conceived as either a preparatory step towards doctoral studies or as a theoretical enrichment for applied design research and practice. Moreover, the programme fosters international cultural exchange, personal growth and as such paves the way for a meaningful level of social engagement.","01 Introductory Phase / Preliminary LaboratoryThree weeks [ECTS Part of 02 Laboratory]The preliminary laboratory (three weeks) provides access to the programme. This involves a general introduction to the various positions in design research and the working practices and methods of scientific work. Selected examples of design research will be analysed and reflected on in seminars.02 Design Research Laboratory12 weeks [10 ECTS]The laboratory is made up of three thematic building blocks: design as research, design as education, and design as projection. In lectures, seminars, and exercises, these diverse modes of design knowledge production will be systematically analysed both historically and theoretically and argued in presentations based on selected examples.03 ProposalSix weeks [5 ECTS]Following on 02 Laboratory, the insights, methods and skills acquired in the first semester will be applied in a self-chosen thematic project. The proposal serves as a test phase for an independent, original design research argumentation.04 Lecture Series & Seminar: Theories and Methods of Scientific WorkWeekly [5 ECTS]The lecture series offers an overview of the history of modern design research and presents discourses, projects, and concepts in the field.The seminar will reflect on different approaches to the development of theories in, e.g. the natural sciences, the humanities, and design. The seminar also includes an introduction to various methods of scientific work, e.g. literature research, archive study techniques, data analysis, interview techniques, qualitative methods, e.g. participatory observation or material studies and aims to enable students to take a reflexive approach to these methods.05 COOP Module[5 ECTS]The COOP module comprises intensive sessions in which partner universities present their research areas and introduce participants to the issues arising from these contexts. The COOP module broadens the thematic spectrum and enlarges the teaching content of the lectures and modules.06 Master Talk / Research Colloquium[5+5 ECTS]The Master Talks offer a platform for international exchange on approaches to design research. Guest scientists and designers present their research approaches and hypotheses for discussion. In accompanying or separately organised research colloquia, the programme's participants, in association with the guests, can deepen their understanding of issues arising from the contexts of the respective themes.07 Master's Thesis and Colloquium[20+5 ECTS]The Master's thesis follows up on the proposal.

The main challenge for a reliable, economically and ecologically feasible energy supply lies in the efficient, secure and reliable digitalisation of a technical system that integrates a huge, fluctuating, and difficult-to-forecast number of energy generators, consumers, storage facilities and grid components into a technically stable and financially viable overall system. In addition, the energy system is a critical infrastructure – the lifeline of modern societies. The failure or impairment of such a system would result in long lasting supply bottlenecks, significant disruptions to public safety or other dramatic effects.This degree programme enables graduates to conduct research at research institutions or universities on the still missing elements of a successful digitalisation in the energy domain and thus on the implementation of the energy transition; or to occupy diverse positions in the energy industry due to the high practical relevance of the study content.The Master's programme consists of a compulsory part, which teaches core competences in the field of designing and engineering of cyber-physical energy systems. These competences reflect the diversity of energy informatics systems and their fields of application and, together with various thematic specialisation options, allow for a meaningful deepening and specialisation with respect to individual interests. Different domain-specific application perspectives are taught independently so that students acquire broad application knowledge that goes beyond the specific energy system class. Societal and socio-technical issues are also represented as a cross-sectional topic.The courses cover the following topics and more:Smart gridsRenewable energy(Distributed) Artificial intelligenceCo-simulationDesign and assessment of experimentsControl theoryCritical engineeringEnergy marketsRequirements engineeringModelling and controlCyber-resilienceIn a cross-group research project, which addresses control at the component level, communication, and also the use of agents in the context of optimisation in energy systems, the learned contents are consolidated and tested in practice.","The degree programme consists of the following content areas:""Fundamental Competencies"" with a scope of 54 CP teaches basic competencies from the areas of computer science, automation, and electrical engineering. This area is subdivided into ""Automation and Electrical Engineering"" and ""Computer Science and Energy Informatics"" to reflect the interdisciplinary nature of the degree programme, which maps the aspects that are required to develop and analyse necessary system intelligence in the energy system. The courses from both areas are therefore also strongly interlinked in terms of content in order to bring together practical skills from computer science, electrical engineering and an engineering approach in designing cyber-physical energy systems right from the start.""Foundations of Digitalised Energy Systems"" with a scope of 36 CP aims to impart competencies and knowledge in the future field of digitalised energy systems. This area is subdivided into ""Digitalised Energy System Automation, Control and Optimisation"" and ""Digitalised Energy System Design and Assessment"" in order to take into account the different technical system classes with their respective specific design and analysis methods.

From domestic devices like washing machines to complex space technology such as satellites, most products require integrated digital control and software. These components have a great impact on functionality and performance. With more than 16 billion devices, embedded systems are everywhere. As ""hidden systems"", the embedded systems determine innovations in industrial equipment, medical devices, and scientific instruments. Since many products without embedded systems cannot compete on the market, specially trained personnel are demanded by the industry worldwide.Bremerhaven University of Applied Sciences recognises these demands and offers a new Master's study programme Embedded Systems Design (ESD). An embedded system in the scope of ESD is a system whereby a mechanical or electromechanical system receives its essential functionality via electronics, control, and software. Courses like system identification, mechatronics, and discrete control systems qualify students to design future embedded systems in industrial, medical, or scientific applications (ISM market). ESD pays attention to system-on-chip (SoC) solutions using programmable digital devices. The graduate students will meet the challenge of designing modern, safe, and reliable embedded products.Requirements: engineering is an integral part of ESD.Applicants should be interested in control engineering, mechanics, programmable logic systems (FPGAs), and software development.

High economic losses, the loss of human life and the endangerment of social structures have to be overcome regularly. Predicting the effects of these forces in terms of their extent, space, time and intensity and minimising their consequences is a central, interdisciplinary challenge at a local, national and global level. The intensities of extreme exogenous natural events (storms, storm surges, heavy rainfall events) are increasing, but endogenous natural events (earthquakes, volcanic eruptions) also regularly occur with varying degrees of damage. Complex chains and cascading catastrophes that follow an initial extreme natural event are often of no less intensity (tsunamis, mass movements) and cumulative in their extent.The Master's degree programme in Engineering Geohazards (EGH) is interdisciplinarily linked between natural sciences, engineering and economics. In four semesters, a comprehensive geoscientific basis is taught to understand the complex impact of natural hazards and assess their consequences for society. In order to protect lives from the consequences of natural disasters, the responsible development and design of engineering protection measures is an essential part of this programme. Furthermore, the course of study imparts skills for sustainable preparation and rehabilitation of the habitat in the area of conflict between disaster prevention, national and business economics and ecology, since coping with disasters is associated with high costs. In the long term, graduates are expected to contribute to better control and to develop a sustainable design of our living space. Practical experience and the option of an applied Master's thesis in the partner companies as part of a research module are an integral part of the curriculum. This period is thus also intended as a fixed mobility window. There is also the possibility to attend courses within the geoscientific network of the Aachen/Bonn/Cologne/Jülich research area within the ABC-J module, especially if these courses complement the RWTH Aachen University's offers.","In the first year of study, the focus is on understanding processes and fundamentals in the field of geo- and engineering sciences. In addition, a research module is integrated, which should enable the development of models and the critical evaluation, the assessment of strengths and weaknesses as well as the estimation of uncertainties of these models. Thereby, contents learned shall be linked while space for innovative approaches will also be offered. Integrated into a current research project (from academia and/or industry), the processing and evaluation of data related to natural hazards and the sensitive and valuable public relations work related to this topic will be trained.In the second year of study, the acquired basics will be deepened.

Recognising that environmental questions can no longer be solved by a singular academic discipline, the programme offers a broad spectrum of courses ranging from engineering and science to management and socioeconomics. The acquisition of soft skills (e.g. cultural competence) is thus valued as highly and as indispensably as that of technical and scientific knowledge. Due to the small seminar courses and the resulting good lecturer-student ratio, the quality of the study programme is extremely high and allows close interrelation between the students and their academic supervisors.The Master's programme is a four-semester study programme. It builds consecutively on the ERM Bachelor's programme. The idea of the Master's programme is to provide students with a broad spectrum of environmental courses.You can choose between three specialisations when applying: environmental sciences; environmental economics, planning, and law; and environmental engineering.The environmental sciences area offers modules from the natural sciences and related fields with a specific environmental focus (e.g. general and applied ecology, environmental modelling, freshwater restoration ecology, environmental soil science and plant nutrition, geopedology, systems and process hydrology, introduction to climate variability and climate change projections, geoecology, microclimates, land surface - atmosphere interactions, and parasites).The environmental economics, planning, and law specialisation offers students various planning and management courses (e.g. advanced studies of international environmental law, climate change and migration, strategic environmental assessment and environmental impact assessment, cost-benefit analysis in environmental evaluation, economics of land use and biodiversity conservation, methods of water resources management, and municipal solid waste management).The third specialisation, environmental engineering, represents the technical part of the study programme (e.g. numerical simulation: free surface and groundwater modelling, modelling process in hydro engineering projects, information management in hydroinformatics systems, hydrology and hydraulics, renewable energy technologies for power supply, gas cleaning, natural resource investigation, safety and risk-analysis for process plants, and wastewater and sludge treatment).For more information, please visit:https://www.b-tu.de/en/environment-ms/.","In the study programme, there are two mandatory modules: the introduction module and the study project. The introduction module serves as a foundational course for all students entering the programme. It provides an overview of the study programme and familiarises students with the key concepts and methodologies that they will encounter throughout their studies.The study project is a collaborative effort in which students demonstrate their scientific skills and enhance their abilities in project planning and team-oriented work. This module allows students to apply the knowledge they have acquired during their studies to a real-world project. It serves to enhance practical experience and develop problem-solving capabilities among the students.When applying for the study programme, students are required to choose one of the three specialisations that aligns with their previous studies. Within their chosen specialisation, students must select a minimum of seven modules to complete. These modules delve deeper into the specific subject matter of the specialisations and provide students with advanced knowledge and expertise in their chosen fields.In addition to the specialisation modules, students must also complete five modules from the area of compulsory elective modules. These modules can be selected from different specialisations, allowing students to explore other areas of interest or broaden their knowledge beyond their primary specialisation.Furthermore, the study programme offers students the opportunity to spend a semester abroad. The curriculum is designed to incorporate this experience without extending the overall duration of the programme. Students can choose to study at one of the programme's partner universities, which allows them to gain international exposure and broaden their cultural and academic horizons.Overall, the study programme aims to provide students with a comprehensive education that combines theoretical knowledge with practical application, teamwork, and international experiences. The objective is to equip students with the necessary skills and knowledge for successful careers in their chosen fields.",Yes,International guest lecturersInternational comparisons and thematic reference to the international contextContent-related regional focus,No mandatory internships,,No,No,"Apart from a few degree programmes, education offered at the BTU Cottbus-Senftenberg is without tuition fees.

The Master's programme in Food Science and Technology is research-oriented and focuses on the interface between complex food matrices and technical processes in the development and production of food.In this programme, students acquire expertise regarding the equipment and processes involved in the processing of food, combined with a thorough understanding of the biogenesis of raw materials and their microbiological ecology. They learn to develop appropriate food formulas and processing techniques that allow for product-specific processing conditions in automated production processes using in-line sensor technology. The core of the programme consists of the development of new technologies for the production of food products that meet both consumer expectations and individual nutritional requirements, i.e. the transfer of basic research concepts into new technological approaches.","The programme in Food Science and Technology has a modular structure with each module encompassing at least one, but usually several, interconnected courses. These include lectures, exercises, seminars and practical courses in the laboratory.In the first semester of the programme, the focus lies on connecting soft matter science approaches with microbiological knowledge and engineering methods needed to understand all aspects of the processing of the complex food matrix. You analyse treatment processes for food and explore new technology with which functional compounds from plant-based or animal-based raw materials may be efficiently gained, enzymatically modified or stabilised through encapsulation. At the same time, you learn scientific approaches, including modern chemical, physical, molecular and statistical methods, as well as methods for modelling and simulating unit operations, processes, and reactions. During practical courses you put your acquired skills to practice, whilst exploring food processing in natural scientific, engineering, and economic contexts during seminars.Starting in the second semester, you are free to plan your studies according to your individual interests and preferred areas of specialisation. You do so by choosing from a wide range of elective modules, such as:Bioethanol and Distilled SpiritsAdvanced Technologies for Dairy Products and AlternativesFood Product DevelopmentDrying, Granulation, and InstantisationAdvanced Meat Science and TechnologyFood MicrobiologyBiotechnologyIntegrated Bioprocess EngineeringThe selection of elective modules on offer allows you to develop your scientific qualifications to include areas of the field not covered within the scope of the compulsory modules. You may also take modules in other areas of the life sciences, such as the nutritional sciences. In addition to subject-specific modules, you may complete modules offered in other Master's programmes in the natural sciences at the University of Hohenheim or at other universities, both in Germany and abroad.The second year allows you to plan your studies freely according to your individual interests and preferred areas of specialisation. Knowledge and practical skills acquired in the first year are expanded by further specialising in selected areas of the field, such as the interaction between ingredients in the complex food matrix. The emphasis on conducting research increases. Project work modules give you the opportunity to apply your acquired skills within the context of a scientific project by independently planning and executing scientific research projects, with a supervisor providing guidance as needed.The open structure of the second year also provides you with a perfect opportunity to study abroad or undertake a prolonged internship at national or international research facilities or in the life science industry.

These sites are not only icons of national and local identity but also important resources for scientific research and economic advancement. However, in their often inevitably incomplete state, archaeological sites do not easily lend themselves to interpretation by the untrained eye.

Complex networked products and services need intensive communication between developers and engineers from various disciplines, companies, and research institutes – for today and tomorrow’s applications.The Free State of Bavaria provides additional funding for the expansion of the Faculty of Engineering and the development of the degree programme in Information and Communications Technology to supply the labour market with the specialists it urgently needs in this field. The funding enables the support provided to students to be improved and finances new professorships, which extends the range of courses for students.ICT is especially well positioned in Erlangen, thanks to the short distances and excellent collaboration between the Department of Electrical Engineering, Electronics, and Communication; the Department of Computer Science; two Fraunhofer Institutes specialising in ICT; and a unique landscape of international as well as small and medium-sized companies that are also active in this field. This excellent collaboration led to the development of the MP3 format, which became a global success. Some of the ICT professors in Erlangen were involved in developing the MP3 format. With such inspiring teachers, ICT students in Erlangen have a positive outlook towards collaboration and look forward to welcoming new students to the degree programme.Embedded systems (products in which a computer is embedded) are a particular focus of ICT. German research and industry is at the top of the game worldwide in embedded systems. Well-known researchers in this field teach in Erlangen. Additionally, several small and large companies operate in and around Erlangen, in Bavaria and in Germany in this field. Every year, Nuremberg is host to Embedded World, the most important trade show in this sector. The region is also well known for developing open-source software for embedded systems.Electronics engineers and information scientists in Erlangen are currently working on joint research projects, such as the Communicating Cars (CoCars) project. This project is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, and in this project, traffic information is sent rapidly between vehicles via mobile technology. In this project, mobile communication companies are working with the automotive industry, electronics engineers in Erlangen are developing wireless transmission systems, and computer scientists in Erlangen are developing higher-level communication protocols. Further work includes simulating the interaction between traffic, hardware, and communication as well as developing strategies for commercial exploitation. The project can only succeed if everyone communicates efficiently and can understand each other’s work. ICT students have the opportunity to work on such projects in current research, thus gaining experience and making contacts.","Mandatory modules from three different areas of study (Embedded Systems, Networks and Digital Communication, Media Processing Systems)Elective modules from the Department of Electrical Engineering and the Department of Computer ScienceElective modules from the Faculty of Engineering or the Faculty of SciencesElective modules from all subjects offered by FAULab courseSeminarMaster’s thesis with a presentation,Research projectPDF Download",Yes,Language training providedTraining in intercultural skills,Research internship,,No,No,"FAU does not charge tuition fees.

For more information, please check the IUSD website.","Our teaching philosophyThe teaching philosophy is to provide students with support and guidance in expanding their individual expertise in the field of ""Integrated Urbanism and Sustainable Design"" while at the same time, they learn to work on complex, practice-based case-studies in interdisciplinary teams. The programme aims to equip the students with the necessary practical and conceptual skills to develop holistic, interdisciplinary, collaborative, and innovative approaches to sustainable urbanism and design - and to apply this knowledge to practical tasks in order to solve complex problems in a collaborative way. Students are trained to become ""generalists with a speciality"". As the programme progresses, the teaching methods shift from a more theoretical approach and the study of concepts and tools to practical application of the acquired knowledge and tools to the design tasks. The teaching methodology combines the following:1) Knowledge-based learningStudents will acquire a broad understanding of the various facets of ""eco-urbanism"", learning to relate environmental knowledge, technical expertise, and socio-cultural awareness (compulsory core modules) and expanding their individual expertise by specialising in aspects of ""eco-urbanism"" selected according to their varying pre-qualifications and personal learning goals (elective specialisation modules). Once they satisfy the core requirements, students must use their electives to pursue a specific track (specialisation modules). Students are encouraged and given guidance to develop a programme that will strengthen their analytic skills, broaden their intellectual outlook, and test their acquired insight in real-world applications. The programme also strives to nurture intellectual independence, self-reliance, and personal growth.2) Application-based learningStudents will learn to apply their knowledge to practical tasks of varying complexity in an interdisciplinary hands-on learning environment based on the design approach (integrated research and design studios). In the second semester, they will refine the acquired skills working on small design projects of different scales in small student groups. During the first and second semesters in Germany, the students will reinforce their skills by working in small groups on design projects of different scales and complexities. In the third semester, the whole group is required to work together on a large case-study project based in the MENA region. This project will synthesise what they have learned in their first year and bring together the different specialisations within the group. The application-based learning approach is closely linked to the course's partner institutions and enables the students to develop close relationships with them. Thus, students are encouraged to be an active part of project development and decision-making processes.3) Learning outcome and prospects/career optionsProgramme graduates will be equipped to work in international organisations, in national and local governments and urban agencies, non-profit agencies, non-governmental organisations, and planning/design companies. They will also be prepared for academic careers and be well positioned for PhDs and international research projects.",,International guest lecturersIntegrated study abroad unit(s)Specialist literature in other languagesLanguage training providedTraining in intercultural skillsStudy tripsProjects with partners in Germany and abroadInternational comparisons and thematic reference to the international context,,DAAD development-related postgraduate course,No,No,Approx. 200 EUR per semester,"Living expenses amount to about 940 EUR per month.

Combining an intensive, critical and analytical approach to computational design simulation and fabrication processes, the ITECH programme is focussing on challenging the design space boundaries of current contemporary architectural and engineering practice. It seeks to provoke a re-examination of techniques, methods and theories of design in relation to the fields of engineering, robotics, digital manufacturing, material science and biology.All programme courses are instructed in English. The modules of the core ITECH programme are taught by researchers at ICD and ITKE with oversight of Professor Menges and Professor Knippers and input from visiting researchers and scientists.Technological progress has always been a catalyst for design innovation in architecture and construction. Today, technological advancements across multiple disciplines suggest a profound transformation of the way the future built environment is conceived, designed and materialised. New alliances are being forged between the fields of design, engineering and natural sciences, leading to novel multidisciplinary and multifaceted design cultures. Design plays a critical role in this transformation: Here, the notion of design is extended beyond the design of space, surface and structure to the design of processes, systems and reciprocities.The ITECH programme investigates the realm of integrative technological advancements as novel potentials in architecture and construction. It seeks to prepare students for the complex contemporary conditions found in the building industry, which is facing stringent environmental and economic challenges while experiencing the emergence of new technical opportunities at an unprecedented speed. Thus, the Master's programme is inquiry-oriented, experiment-based and shaped around contemporary aspects of design research. Students will engage in cutting-edge computational architectural design techniques, structural and climate engineering and advanced fabrication and construction technologies. The interrelation of such topics will be exposed both as a technical and an intellectual venture.The programme offers the opportunity to study with one of the leading teams for technological and computational design research. As a team, the partner institutes strive to present students with a cutting-edge educational experience that fosters the development of one’s individual interests in architectural design, structures, technology and computation.If you are an architect, engineer, materials scientist, biologist, or other with a deep interest in how the design and fabrication of our built environment will develop alongside increasingly powerful computation and fabrication technology, the ITECH MSc programme is for you.","The curriculum is based on the German semester system: the winter semester typically takes place between mid-October and mid-February with a two-week Christmas break, while the summer semester takes place between mid-April and mid-July. It is important to note that this is a full-time programme. Coursework and studio submissions take place outside of these lecture times.First year - During the first year, the curriculum is led by two design research projects that are developed as a collaborative undertaking between the involved institutes. The introduction to relevant topics in computational design, engineering and construction is provided through two supplementary seminar modules per semester. In addition, a series of regular colloquia will expose the students to presentations in cutting edge research by leading experts in the related fields. Both, seminar modules and expert colloquia are structured to provide relevant support for the project development.Second year - The third semester is aimed at laying the foundation for a promising Master's thesis through a thesis preparation project. This main module is supported by two supplementary seminar modules and an elective 3 ECTS course of particular relevance for the planned research thesis. The entire fourth semester is dedicated to the development of the Master's thesis.The ECTS structure of the programme is equivalent to the faculty's general Master's programme Architecture and Urban Planning.

The Master's programme in International Automotive Engineering provides an opportunity for students to gain a deep understanding in those engineering disciplines upon which the life cycle of the production automobile is based.The programme is conceived so as to offer a focused graduate course of study covering manifold aspects of automotive engineering. These aspects range from the potential of control units used in automobiles to driver assistance systems. The theoretical foundations of industrial practice and practical applications of the theory of automotive electronics, and control theory, development methodologies, etc. will be presented in a well-balanced fashion.Furthermore, the rapid increase in the amount of economic activity taking place across national boundaries has changed the job requirements of engineers. Particularly in the automotive industry, employees who are familiar with methods of communication and cooperation in international teams and who have learnt to gain access to foreign cultures are in demand. Therefore, due to the multicultural composition of the trainee group, the language of instruction is English.The Master's programme addresses qualified and dedicated students from all countries with an undergraduate degree in an engineering discipline or in computer science. The programme particularly addresses students who want to take on responsibility for tasks in development, organisation, and management in the automotive industry.","In particular, the Master's programme teaches the engineering-scientific approach within the range of automobile development. It explains the language and symbols to be used in automobile projects. However, scientifically-oriented work in a Master's programme means that students learn independently and take on responsibility themselves.Several modules are offered to deepen and enlarge the knowledge gained during undergraduate studies. Furthermore, students have to choose two modules of specialisation. Additionally, students will take part in a common module and in a team project, which will be completed in international and intercultural teams in the labs of the university.

This diverse and interdisciplinary industry is considered a key technology and innovation driver of the 21st century. Optical processes, image and data transmission, optical information and communication technology, laser technology and much more are components of the study programme.Strictly, the term “Photonics” stands for the science of photons. Today the term incorporates many novel disciplines. In essence, it is related to four application areas, where “Photonics” is used to combine applied research and development. These are:laser and light material interaction,industrial manufacturing,illumination and displays,biophotonics in the domain of Life Science.Specifically, “Photonics” not only denotes the particle properties of light, the term incorporates all practical applications of optics, and the potential to create, transport and process optical signals. Photonic techniques are used in various fields, e.g. the combination of medical problems and photonic technologies exhibit a high economical potential.This course is for students who want to achieve special knowledge of innovative technologies in photonics. Additionally, this course addresses professionals with a Bachelor‘s degree who seek a higher occupational qualification by completing a Master’s degree. These people study while continuing in their jobs.The course prepares students with ambitions for a PhD position afterwards.

Due to the Economic and Social Statistics Department’s main research priorities, a special emphasis is put oncomputational (survey) statistics. The four specialisations are as follows:Survey Statistics,European Master in Official Statistics (EMOS),Data Science, andGeostatistics. In addition to profiting from the curriculum of the programme, students can get insights into actual statistical research through theResearch Institute for Official and Survey Statistics (RIFOSS)located at Trier University.As the need for evidence-based policies and thus for sound complex data analyses rises, the need for well-trained applied statisticians increases as well. Through its structure, the Master's programme ensures that students are not only trained in statistics but also get insights into subject matters like economics, social sciences, etc., creating amultidisciplinary environment. Graduates are thus able to fine-tune their profiles to prepare for their desired future lines of work (even within their chosen specialisation tracks). This ability is further enhanced by a collaboration with the University of Bamberg, using modern teleteaching facilities. This ensures abroad spectrum of lecturesfrom which students may choose. An internationaldouble Master's degreewith the University of Pisa as well as a study abroad programme usingERASMUSfunding are possible. Double Master's degrees in combination with programmes such as Business Mathematics, Data Science, Economics, and Economic Sociology provide further possibilities for students to shape their individual study tracks.Trier is located close to the Statistical Office of the European Union (Eurostat) and other European institutions in Luxembourg. It is not far from the German Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) in Wiesbaden and the German Central Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank) in Frankfurt am Main either. Accordingly,high-profile internship opportunitiesare nearby. Graduates will typically work in national statistical institutes (NSIs), central banks, or quantitatively-oriented research institutes, or they can pursue PhD studies (for especially excellent students potentially at the Economic and Social Statistics Department at Trier University) and an academic career.

Students thus may work full time for 120 days or part time (up to four hours per day) for 240 days. This regulation is also stated on the residence permit.During the semester, students are allowed to take up jobs with working hours of up to 19 hours a week. During the semester break, students may work full time but only for a maximum of 13 consecutive weeks. To give an example: A student takes up a job at a restaurant. She or he is scheduled to work for 19 hours per week. According to the regulation stated above, the student is allowed to work for 48 weeks of the year. The student's employer is advised to register the number of days that the student has worked in order to avoid difficulties with the Immigration Office.Student assistants are more flexible with regard to working hours since the aforementioned regulation does not apply. As a student assistant - the so-called ""HiWi"" – you are allowed to work up to 19 hours per week throughout the year.

The staff at the International Office can only provide you with information about providers and give you an overview of different options. Here are a few tips to prepare you for apartment hunting in Aachen:Begin your search for housing at least three months before you come. Use the numerous addresses and information on our webpages. When searching for an apartment, you can apply to both the private apartment market or to the Studierendenwerk dorms.In order to increase your chances of finding a room or an apartment, it is important that you are flexible about the location and take the outer districts of Aachen and surrounding cities into consideration. Please note that if you are not a citizen of the EU, the conditions of your visa may not allow you to live outside of Germany.Reserve a room early on for your first few days or weeks in Aachen – for example, in a hostel or guesthouse. That way, you can be sure that you have short-term housing and can continue to look for permanent housing once you are here.The availability and demand of the housing market often determine whether you find a private apartment, a shared flat, or a room in a student dorm. Your search can take longer than you expect. You aren't alone though; almost all new students at RWTH are in the same situation. Start your search early and don't be shy about asking for help.",A dedicated course advisory service is available to all students.

While it is not easy to define data science in a few words, data science deals with the methods and tools needed to analyse (large amounts of) data and draw actionable conclusions from the results gained in the process. These methods and tools (covering big data and their analysis, data modelling, machine learning, and simulation methods) are located at the intersection of three subjects: computer sciences, mathematics, and statistics. Consequently, this new Master's programme at Trier University is jointly taught by lecturers from the fields of computer sciences, mathematics, and statistics (whereas other data science programmes typically only cover one or two of these fields). This ensures that graduates will have a broad knowledge of the discipline and will be able to approach actual problems from different angles. They will also be trained to be life-long learners, able to rapidly adapt to changing demands in their working environments.In the first semester of this multidisciplinary programme, propaedeutics courses make sure that students coming from different study backgrounds will be able to successfully follow the programme. State-of-the-art e-learning concepts (e.g. flipped classrooms, electronic tutorials, etc.) engage students and offer additional flexibility regarding learning periods. A small research project is a compulsory part of the programme. During this project, students will apply their acquired knowledge to real world problems and learn to approach these problems with scientific methods. The project also serves to strengthen the students' soft skills.A broad choice of courses (including other subjects like economics, environmental sciences, etc.) enables students to tailor their course of study to their specific needs and targeted working environments.Students will be able to earn a double Master's degree in combination with computer sciences, business informatics, applied mathematics, business mathematics, or applied statistics.The MSc in Data Science also serves as a solid foundation for future PhD students in the related fields.","The Master's programme covers the following module types:Compulsory modules:Introductory courses (e.g. Big Data Analytics, Data and Web Mining, Numerical Optimisation for Data Science, Statistical Methods of Data Science) as well as propaedeutics coursesElective modules within the following specialisation tracks:Algorithmic Optimisation, Applied Statistics, Data and Knowledge Systems, Financial Economics, Geoinformatics, Natural Language Processing, Simulation StudiesResearch case studiesMaster's thesis",Yes,International guest lecturersInternational comparisons and thematic reference to the international context,There are no integrated internships.,,No,No,"Trier University does not charge tuition fees.

Two common features, however, remain constant: they all require means of transport to the remotest corners and, at the same time, they are hugely influential parameters for the economy, for prosperity, and for the climate. The world of automotive engineering is confronted with the complex task of reconciling these aspects. This only works with modern ideas, and above all, the global impact must be taken into account.The Master's degree programme in ""International Automotive Engineering"" therefore imparts in-depth knowledge about existing and new technologies, the interactions between technology and sustainability and, last but not least, the globally networked activities in the automotive industry. To this end, the degree programme includes various practical trainings in the laboratory, and group work as well as more advanced modules aimed at educating you for your future path with enthusiasm and enjoyment.In the first two semesters, the Master's degree programme comprises modules from the general engineering sciences on the one hand, and from subject-specific modules in the areas of vehicle development, drive engineering and vehicle interior on the other hand. These can either be chosen freely or pursued on the basis of a fixed specialisation (focus area).Accordingly, the Master of Science in International Automotive Engineering can be obtained in the following ways:General Automotive Engineering (free choice)Computational Aided Engineering AutomotiveAutomotive Propulsion EngineeringAutomotive Body EngineeringThe Master's thesis takes place in the third semester.This programme will provide you with the necessary skills needed to solve problems and tasks from product development, research and quality assurance independently, in a team, or as a leader.Optionally, the Master's degree is offered as a four-semester degree programme leading to the double degree of Master of Science and Master of Engineering. The last two semesters are completed at our partner university, the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) in Australia.","During the first and second academic semesters, students deepen their basic understanding of engineering sciences and widen their specialised knowledge in automotive fields, such as Environmental Impacts of Vehicle Propulsion Systems,  Vehicle Acoustics, Vehicle Engineering – FEM, Powertrain Calibration or Global Automotive Homologation. In the third semester, students carry out their research for the Master's thesis. About 70% of the final projects are written in or in cooperation with industry.Modules are presented in the form of lectures and tutorials. Many courses offer accompanying laboratory or workshop practice.The collaboration in a qualification network group with outstanding selected partners from industry and research institutions is one of the unique characteristics of this course.

In addition to the content already mentioned, students can individualise their course of study from the beginning and deepen personal interests through electives from an elective catalogue. The elective content is organised over three semesters, so that there is a balanced relationship in the parallel pursuit of compulsory and elective content. Students are given a high degree of flexibility in the design of their studies.In the third semester, the range of courses is supplemented by the acquisition of further practical knowledge. Within the framework of a specialist laboratory and a scientific (industrial) project, students learn how to work independently on specific problems. This should enable students to compare the manufacturing processes they have become familiar with in industrial practice with current developments in the individual subject areas. In addition, students learn how to organise and successfully implement projects involving several participants.

Modern education in the engineering sciences must, in turn, prepare students not only in classical disciplines, serving the needs of specific industries, but it must also address the need for interdisciplinary training.The Master's degree programme in Materials Science and Engineering rises to this challenge by offering a scientific, interdisciplinary education in engineering, involving a variety of disciplines such as chemistry, electrical engineering, information technology, computer science, mechanical engineering, mathematics, and physics. Key objectives of this programme include enabling students to physically and mathematically model complex technical-physical processes and systems accounting for the materials to be employed, that is, to theoretically comprehend and apply the fundamental disciplines of engineering and to chemically and physically describe them. Additionally, the programme accounts for the current paradigm shift away from deterministic models towards predictive science. It is for this reason that the TUM MS&E programme is unique, as it is designed to give students a probabilistic view of the material properties of physical and engineering science systems from the start and, thus, it conveys the necessity of stochastic modelling, which has not yet made its way into the curricula of other programmes.What you will learnUpon successful completion of the Master's degree programme in Materials Science and Engineering, you will:have an in-depth knowledge of modelling, calculation, prediction, monitoring and testing of innovative material solutions for complex applications across all technology sectors,recognise the need for the quantification of predictive quality, the probability distributions of results, and the quantification of risk and uncertainty,be able to design and implement scientific and interdisciplinary projects in the field of materials science as applied to the engineering disciplines, andhave acquired the methodological and cognitive skills that enable you to develop and carry out research in this field or, alternatively, to seamlessly progress to a PhD degree programme.","In the first part of the programme (semesters one and two), students acquire sound fundamental disciplinary knowledge.

Light plays a key role in turning this ambitious vision into reality. In biomedical research, modern optical and photonic techniques allow for monitoring and manipulating life processes in cells and tissues on a molecular level. But also in clinical practice, optical and photonic techniques are well established in many fields of medicine, like in ophthalmology, endoscopy or biomedical imaging.To meet the demand for scientists trained in the interdisciplinary field of medical photonics, the Faculties of Medicine, Chemistry and Earth Sciences, and Physics and Astronomy of the Friedrich Schiller University Jena decided to conjointly establish the MSc Medical Photonics programme. It conveys basic and advanced insights into the quickly developing field of medical photonics.It is targeted at students holding a Bachelor of Science degree in physics, chemistry, biochemistry, and biology, but also at medical doctors and students of medicine. It provides students of these disciplines with the necessary training in the neighbouring disciplines and offers a comprehensive cross-disciplinary study programme. The aim of the programme is to provide all students with the necessary knowledge and practical skills to use and develop optical/photonic tools for biomedical research and clinical applications.Although the interdisciplinary training of students in medicine, life sciences, physics, and chemistry is a central goal of this programme, it is at the same time a big challenge. Since students with different knowledge and skills have to be taught, adjustment modules offered in the first year of the programme aim at complementing the students' knowledge in the neighbouring disciplines. Additional modules give all students training in fundamental techniques, such as programming, statistics, and image processing. Elective courses in the second and third semesters allow the student to focus on topics in which they are interested and to gather all the skills to work on the Master's thesis, which will be concluded in the fourth semester. You can find more details on theprogramme website.Assistance and advice are offered at all stages to students of the MSc Medical Photonics programme. Help to prepare the stay in Jena is given by theInternational Office. Counselling during the programme is provided by the coordinator and the lecturers.In addition, several courses aimed at improving the personal and scientific skills are offered to students, including training in presentation skills, scientific writing and good scientific practice.","The curriculum has a modular structure. Credit points are granted according to the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) for every successfully completed module. The individual modules are grouped into five ""blocks"".Modules of the ""Adjustment"" block offered in the first and second semester of the Master's programme aim at complementing the student's knowledge in the neighbouring disciplines. Modules in this block impart knowledge in mathematics, physics, physical chemistry, spectroscopy, and human biology.Additional modules within the ""Fundamentals"" block give the students training in basic skills such as programming, statistics and image processing. These skills are fundamental to all of the other modules. Modules of this block also give an introduction to biomedical imaging techniques.Elective courses can be selected in the second and third semester. Modules within the ""Specialisation"" block allow students to focus in more depth on special topics of Medical Photonics, such as microscopy (biological microscopy, single-molecule microscopy, electron microscopy, nano-optics, labels for biological specimens), spectroscopy, and diagnostics (microspectroscopy, chemometrics, optical sensors, microfluidics, mass spectroscopy) as well as clinical applications (ophthalmology, medical diagnosis and therapy, theranostics, biomaterials) and important tools in Medical Photonics (lasers, optical fibres). Furthermore, students interested in mathematics and informatics will have the possibility to enhance their skills in additional modules (e.g., advanced mathematics, image understanding, visual recognition and analysis, management of scientific data).Lectures and seminars are accompanied bypractical courses. In the first and second semesters, a practical lab course allows students to put the theory into practice. During this course, students can carry out experiments in set-ups located in the departments of physics, physical chemistry, and physiology. During the third semester, a research-oriented practical course provides the possibility to participate in a current research project of one of the research groups participating in the Master's degree programme and introduces the student to the topic of his/her Master's thesis, which will be concluded in the fourth semester (a detailed description of the course organisation can be foundhere).PDF Download",Yes,,"A research internship is supposed to be completed during the third semester.

A wide range of knowledge and skills are expected in managerial positions in the international woodworking industry. This is precisely what the international Master’s programme in Wood Technology offers. It is a joint programme offered by the Rosenheim Technical University of Applied Sciences (GER) and the Bern University of Applied Sciences (CH).Both educational institutes are European leaders in the field of timber. One of the particular strengths of this unique degree programme in Europe is the practical training provided on a high scientific level. Applied research is conducted in close collaboration with leading institutes and enterprises. The course is taught in English and can be completed either as a full-time study course (usual programme duration: three semesters) or as a part-time study course (up to six semesters). Part-time study allows the student to engage in parallel professional activities at a company or in a research department at either university.Career prospectsThe graduates are experts who master the latest concepts and technologies in an international woodworking industry. The knowledge and skills acquired during the programme, and also firmly rooted in practical application, will enable the graduates to become valuable assets to businesses in private enterprise, public services or institutes in the timber, machine, software and consulting area.The graduates will have the skills to enter senior positions in various sectors of activity such as planning, project management, production, technical sales and marketing, distribution, quality control or research and teaching.Our Master of Science programme is also the ideal basis for PhD studies.","Structure of the programmePersonal development in an international environment, expanding skills related to the most recent technologies and methods in the woodworking industry are at the core of the Master’s degree programme.The first semester will give the students a solid foundation in the fields of mathematics, sciences, advanced wood-based materials as well as management and leadership skills. Already in the first semesters students choose one or two individual elective courses.In the second semester, students can choose from a range of different lectures based on their personal preference, for example, Systems Engineering, Special Aspects of Wood Processing, Change Management, Supply Chain Management, Quality Management, Advanced Wood Processing, Furniture Safety and Testing, as well as Innovation Management and New Product Development or Simulation. The second semester is topped off with some courses on economical aspects and the topics of Energy, Wood Supply and Logistics.During the third semester, students will write the Master’s thesis. They will be able to prove that they are capable of working in a scientific and solution-oriented manner and capable of applying scientific methods when dealing with complex problems from the field of wood technology and related business areas. Given the close collaboration with the industry, it is also possible for students to find topics for their Master's theses outside the university.Types of coursesWithin one semester, students have a mixture of weekly lectures and seminars. Depending on the content, different types of courses are used. The courses of the field “Skills for Management” are interactive seminars, including group work. In the module “Advanced Wood Processing”, we are proud to have a cooperation with a company to offer a practical seminar week to our students. The modules taught by professors of the Rosenheim Technical University of Applied Sciences are mostly held as weekly lectures. Guest lecturers from different universities come to Rosenheim to teach block courses. The detailed description of the individual modules and part modules can be found in the actual curriculum published every semester.Required creditsThe aim is to acquire an average of 30 credit points (CP) per semester for full-time students or an average of 15 credit points per semester for part-time students.

The programme is taught in English.The M-ARCH-T programme approaches typology as a model of change with a special potential for current challenges: the densification of cities in many regions goes hand in hand with the development of open-use, hybrid building types. In a process of appropriation and use, existing buildings are constantly being adapted to changing requirements. The differentiation of ways of life in an increasingly connected transcultural society affects the shape and organisation of buildings. With the technical requirements for buildings, the potential of new planning and construction technologies is also increasing. As a result, our knowledge of building types is being questioned again today.The discipline of architecture worldwide is reacting to this development by applying well-known and new typological analysis and design methods. M-ARCH-T is particularly dedicated to this contemporary challenge in architecture. By designing at the crossroads of social and technological aspects, the programme is aiming at developing innovative building types. Students apply and develop corresponding typological analysis and design methods in a teaching environment that is in close proximity to research and practice at the Institute of Architecture.Berlin, as a city and a study environment, serves as a laboratory for typological developments. It is shaped by a great number of diverse typological approaches. It is well known worldwide for its open and pluralistic society, which is constantly evolving new building prototypes.M-ARCH-T is a discourse platform and a type-generation laboratory for the Institute of Architecture, thanks to the various typological expertise and views of the teachers. This continues a tradition of typological work of our institute, represented, for example, by Oswald Mathias Ungers. From 1964 to 1965, Ungers developed his morphological and structural building analysis at the TU Berlin. As a criticism of modernity, he contributed to the renewal and extension of typological methods. In a different contemporary context, M-ARCH-T continues the tradition of critical questioning and the further development of building types.",PDF Download,Yes,International guest lecturersStudy tripsCourses are led with foreign partnersProjects with partners in Germany and abroadInternational comparisons and thematic reference to the international contextContent-related regional focus,,,No,No,https://www.tu.berlin/en/studierendensekretariat/topics-a-z/semester-fees,,No,,"Academic admission requirements include a Bachelor’s degree or equivalent diploma in the same or close course of studies.

In 2006, the term Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) was coined to refer to the integration of computation with physical processes. CPS can be described as smart systems that encompass hardware and software as well as computational and physical components. These are seamlessly integrated, closely interacting to sense and to control the changing state of the real world in real time. These systems involve a high degree of complexity at numerous spatial and temporal scales, and highly networked communications integrating their computational and physical components. As such, CPS refers to Information-Communication-Control-Mechatronics Systems (sensing, actuating, computing, communicating, etc.) embedded in physical objects, interconnected through several networks including the internet, and providing citizens and businesses with a wide range of innovative applications based on digitalised data, information, and services.Ontologically, the term Cyber-Physical Systems means hardware-software systems that tightly couple the physical world and the digitalised (virtual) world. In a CPS ecosystem, on the one hand every real physical object (things/assets) has one or more cyber representations, and on the other hand a cyber component or system can be linked to a physical representation, i.e. an object in the three-dimensional human-tangible world. Moreover, these things are increasingly interconnected in real-operational time, either permanently networked or communicating in an asynchronous manner from time to time, using the Internet (Internet-of-Things, IoT). Digitalised data and information associated to functions of these things are then exposed as services in the Internet (Internet-of-Service, IoS) and they can be consumed by any other CPS for performing business.Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS) forge the core of real-world networked industrial infrastructures that have a cyber representation through digitalisation of data and information across the enterprise, along the product and process engineering life cycle, and from suppliers to customers along the supply chain. As such, the competitive performance of an ICPS mainly depends on the ability to effectively collect, analyse, and use large-scale digitalised data and information from many different and often heterogeneous sources in order to sustainably and efficiently manage, supervise, and operate in the industrial environments. This effective information-driven interaction of ICPS with other real-time critical CPS like IT-enterprise systems, extending to all business processes, is viewed as vital to modern industries.There are many challenges ahead in the convergence of computing, control, mechatronics, communications and software programming for CPS ecosystems. There is a need for investigating and learning a wide spectrum of foundations, research, and technological fields. In this context, the Master in Industrial Informatics with a specialisation in ICPS addresses the penetration and proliferation of such ecosystems in the industrial environments, taking into account that the same trend is also evident in other domains such as energy, healthcare, manufacturing, military, transportation, consumer, enterprise, robotics, and smart cities, among others.","Summer semester (March – August):Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems: 5 CPDigitalisation and Virtualisation of ICPS: 5 CPIndustrial Data Transport Technologies: 5 CPMII Project One: 10 CPCompulsory Optional Subject One: 5 CP: e.g. Innovation Management, Mobile Robotics, etc.Winter semester (September – February):Robotic Systems: 5 CPEngineering ICPS: 5 CPAnalytics and Mathematics: 5 CPMII Project Two: 10 CPCompulsory Optional Subject Two: 5 CP: e.g. Digital Economy and Society, IoT Data Processing, Mixed-Reality Technologies, Data Sciences, etc.Final semester:Master's thesis: 30 CPThe courses are organised in lectures, projects, and laboratory work.For more details about the rationale as well as organisation of the course, please refer to the followingvideo.",Yes,International guest lecturersSpecialist literature in other languagesProjects with partners in Germany and abroadInternational comparisons and thematic reference to the international context,"Students may engage in voluntary internships and projects.

To enable a choice of modules from mainly one semester (summer or winter), the Master's thesis can be started after successful completion of three modules (30 ECTS) and before the other modules are taken.Upon agreement, every semester can include an R&D module of 10 ECTS. Furthermore, after passing a 10 ECTS R&D module, a 20 or 30 ECTS R&D module can be elected upon agreement (for R&D modules a total of 40 ECTS can be chosen).Together with the Master's thesis, this means that 70 out of 90 ECTS in this programme can be gained in R&D work. The R&D module can typically be integrated into third-party-funded research work at the university or it can be done at a company. The university does not provide industrial contacts, but it attempts to match the applicant's interests to research work available in-house. The homepage provides further information and contact data about the responsible professor to whom participants' detailed interests/intentions should be communicated.Depending on personal interests and upon agreement, in the second semester students can take a mobility module (20 or 30 ECTS) at a university abroad. This strengthens cross-cultural competence and foreign language skills. Furthermore, it enables students to acquire specialised in-depth knowledge beyond the scope of our own specialisations.

In recent years, technologies originally developed for microelectronics have been applied increasingly to the fabrication of miniaturised systems in electromechanical, electrooptical, analytical or biomedical applications. The new discipline is called microsystem technology. Future development will certainly result in the integration of microsystem components with microelectronic devices. In order to be able to cope with this challenge, the Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH) has introduced an innovative Master's programme in Microelectronics and Microsystems which combines both aspects.The standard duration of the course is two years. In the first year, students take part in lectures, exercises and laboratory work. A project and a subject-specific seminar or a process design course take place in the third semester. The course is completed with a six-month Master's thesis in the fourth semester.The technological challenges of modern society and the requirements of the globalised labour market call for an excellent engineering education as well as for a sound additional qualification in the fields of business and management, soft skills and humanities. Therefore, the international Master's degree courses at TUHH include a minimum number of non-technical compulsory elective courses.You are passionate about engineering, but do you want to go beyond? You can combine this course with a part-time MBA programme in Technology Management at the NIT Northern Institute of Technology Management. Thus, you will meet the industry demand for engineers with a business education. You will graduate with two Master's degrees simultaneously and benefit from multiple career perspectives.https://www.nithh.de/study/technology-management/double-master","Teaching the methodology and logic of engineering - ""learning to think"" - is a key aspect of studies at TUHH. Only in this way can one acquire the knowledge to keep pace with rapid technological change.

It also comprises the function of proteins in the cell, in tissue and organisms. The interaction with other proteins is also discussed. Essential aspects to be discussed are the structure of proteins and their dynamic characteristics in cellular functions like cellular signalling processes, cell adhesion, cell movement and cell division. These processes are based on biochemical reactions and metabolic pathways, the systematic manipulation of which is studied in detail.In the technological area, the study programme contains the basics of biophysics and biophysical methods. Dynamics, interactions and structure of biological systems are described with the help of physical principles. Furthermore, the methods in bioinformatics enabling to process biological data and investigate their sequence and structure are part of the study programme.","The lectures and lab classes take place primarily during the first three semesters. The lab classes are organised as blocks at the end of each semester. These classes run for several weeks. There are examinations at the end of each semester for each course.The syllabus of the first semester comprises courses in Genomes and Evolution, Introduction to Proteomics, Chemistry with Biomolecules for the Biomedical modules, Biophysics and Structural and Computational Biology for the Technological modules.In the second and third semester, classes in Genome and Stem Cell Engineering, Protein Networks and Protein Engineering for the Biomedical part as well as classes in Cellular Machines, Bionanotechnology and Bioinformatics for the Technological part are taught.Additionally, students can choose to specialise a bit more in one of the areas (Biomedicine/(Nano)technology) choosing Materials in Biomedicine and Tissue Engineering or Nanostructured Materials and Applied Bionanotechnology.In the third semester, there is also a module on public and economic aspects of bioengineering, which discusses ethical and jurisdictional issues, patenting, and how to found and lead biotechnology companies.Half of the third semester includes the work on a lab project.The fourth and final semester is mainly devoted to the Master's thesis.Due to the limited number of students (about 30 per academic year), it is possible to organise the lectures so that the students are actively involved.

Changing working procedures and rationalised processes force engineers to be more and more involved with organisational duties. Key qualifications like team and group work, project organisation, communication and presentation thus become steadily more important as parallel skills and activities alongside the classical technical spectrum of requirements. These requirements can be conveyed by combining the fields of engineering, management, and economics.The course offers three different pathways: Electronics, Mechanical, and Mechatronic Systems. Students taking the Electronics pathway will take two electronic modules. Likewise, students taking the Mechanical pathway will take two mechanical modules. Students taking the Mechatronics pathway will take one mechanical and one electronic module.The final project module will be related to the pathway subject.The course structure has four subject-based components. These are:Systems engineeringManagement systemsAn engineering subject disciplineA project based on the pathwayOnly the engineering subject discipline differentiates the taught elements of the course, the other components are common to all pathways. The engineering discipline bears the pathway name.The programme structure reflects the common generic systems approach to engineering and management. The course treats the systems approach to engineering as generic; this is reflected in the two systems modules: Systems Engineering and Advanced Control Technology. Engineering management is addressed by four modules: Business in Engineering, Technical Publications and Presentations, International Project Management and Integrated Management. Two engineering subject-specific modules define the pathway and focus on the application of the generic system engineering methods in specific application areas. The two electronics modules are Microprocessor based systems and Signal Processing. The two mechanical modules are Monitoring of Mechanical Systems and Advanced Production Engineering. A project module integrates the taught elements of the course. The project can be based on either the engineering pathway or engineering management.","The teaching strategy for this course is aimed at producing graduates who can be readily employed in engineering-based industrial or research organisations and who have all the skills necessary to succeed. The course is targeted at high calibre students wishing to study in the disciplines of the course and as such it is not suitable for students who merely wish to acquire further knowledge without the application of that knowledge in any meaningful sense. In short, although the course is in many ways generic, it is vocational in terms of systems engineering and engineering management.Emphasis is placed on imparting the understanding of the subject including essential facts, concepts and principles underlying the subject. This should leave the student with an ability to critically evaluate, design and apply technologies in a systematic manner to engineering and management issues.For this reason, there are no traditional lectures of the type which merely impart straightforward information. This is too passive a mode of education for students of the 21st century. However, there is still a strong place for the exposition and clarification of themes and difficulties in a lecture-type situation. The acquisition of straightforward knowledge is facilitated by provision of learning material (e.g. via electronic media) and by assigned or recommended reading. The onus for its assimilation is on the students themselves.One major component of the concept of the course is to enhance the students' research competence. The large amount of coursework assessment in the course demands self-directed studies. Although this coursework is based on the lectures and supervised by tutors, the students are challenged to develop their own solutions by using additional resources.

These disciplines play a key role in the development of novel technologies – without new materials, a great range of key inventions from digital computers or jet engines to customised medical implants would not have been possible. Novel materials with new functionalities or improved properties, however, require specifically designed, economically and environmentally sustainable production processes – which might themselves depend on the development of new catalyst materials. This intimate connection between processes and materials is of key importance for advances and innovations in virtually any field of technology. Chemical and Biological Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering are thus highly intertwined fields, which are, however, traditionally treated as separate subjects.MAP is an English-taught, interdisciplinary Master’s programme and provides a unique curriculum for the next generation of engineers. Students follow an individually tailored curriculum to learn the fundamentals of Chemical and Biological Engineering and/or Materials Science and Engineering in small groups. Four focal subjects allow the students to further deepen their knowledge in key technological areas:Advanced ProcessesBiomaterials and BioprocessingComputational Materials Science and Process SimulationNanomaterials and NanotechnologyMAP is a highly-selective, accredited, two-year Master’s programme. It is characterised by a very low student-to-faculty ratio, early involvement in cutting-edge research through mini-projects and literature reviews, special events such as summer schools and workshops, the availability of educational grants, and personal support from the MAP team. Furthermore, students can gain additional qualifications for an academic career or for a career in industry through specialised modules with extra credits. A high percentage of MAP graduates continue to pursue a PhD, but MAP graduates are also highly sought after by industry, with typical destinations including the automotive, aerospace, oil and gas, food technology, health and safety, and pharmaceutical sectors.Scientific EnvironmentMAP is embedded in the Faculty of Engineering of the FAU. Local research centres such as the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Systems and Device Technology (IISB), the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light, the Helmholtz Institute for Renewable Energy Production (HI-ERN), the Institute of Advanced Materials and Processes (ZMP), the Neue Materialien Fürth GmbH (NMF), the Erlangen Catalysis Resource Center (ECRC), and Energy Campus Nürnberg complement the unique research environment in materials and processes.","Programme StructureThe core MAP programme is designed as a four-semester Master's course with the following general structure and semester content. Optional additional qualifications provide the opportunity to gain competences with a focus on research or industry. These additional qualifications consist of courses with a total of 30 ECTS points and will be certified on your final academic transcript.The content of the individual semesters is described in detail on theMAP website.The structure of MAP combines core knowledge in Materials Science and Engineering as well as Chemical and Biological Engineering with more advanced courses in the four focal topics. The core knowledge is taught via ""Fundamentals"" lectures, while the focal topics are introduced via ""Basics"" lectures to provide an overview of the subjects. Each student specialises in two out of four focal topics. The curriculum is complemented by soft skills, scientific skills, and a mini-project, in which students gain first-hand experience with research at the involved institutes. The programme ends with a Master's thesis as an independent research project.Added value of the English language MSc Advanced Materials and ProcessesThe international, English language course “Advanced Materials and Processes” uniquely combines content from Materials Sciences and Chemistry and Bioengineering, thus placing it within the FAU’s research focus on “New Materials and Processes”.

The increasing influx of people can make the search for adequate accommodation quite difficult. Dozens of apartment hunters often compete for one single apartment. This is why we strongly recommend that you start looking for a place to live as soon as possible.Cologne's most convenient and economical housing option is often a student dormitory. A public student services association called ""Kölner Studierendenwerk"" (KSTW) operates 88 student dorms offering roughly 4,800 rooms. The seemingly large number of dorm rooms is misleading; as the dormitories are open to the roughly 90,000 students enrolled at all Cologne universities, they are in extremely high demand. Please be aware that TH Köln does not allocate the rooms in these dorms. Please apply directly to the KSTW:https://www.kstw.de/wohnen.You do not yet need a letter of admission in order to apply.The fierce competition on the private housing market has resulted in above-market rents – particularly in proximity of the city centre.

How can transport networks be logically developed, expanded, relieved, and ecologically planned? How can factors like rolling stock and routing be managed in a way that need-oriented and smooth railway traffic is possible? How do random disturbances in transportation have to be considered in order to avoid jamming or to optimise safety strategies? How can we shift more passenger and freight transport to the rails? Is driverless operation possible for all kinds of rail transport means? When the interaction of technical possibilities, infrastructure, and human behaviour is supposed to be optimised, transport engineers are called upon for their interdisciplinary perspective.Students of the Railway Systems Engineering programme acquire this interdisciplinary expertise by studying the perspectives of three engineering disciplines: civil engineering, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering. The specialisation Railway Systems Engineering (RSE) concentrates on the further development of railway engineering. Students work with rail vehicles, rail transportation systems, and infrastructure developments in rail transportation. This Master's programme covers each aspect of the complete system of ""railway"": the infrastructure, operation, and vehicles, including the electrical drive as well as electric power supply. Furthermore, this is the only specialisation of the Master's degree programme in Transport Engineering and Mobility that can be studied completely in English.Course objectives and future opportunitiesThe objective of this specialisation is to train and educate engineers with multidisciplinary expertise that can take the challenges of the modern railway sector head on. The future possibilities for railways, the eldest of the modern transport means, are the brightest among all others. Railways remain ecologically superior, even as modern high-speed trains compete successfully with short and medium distance aeroplanes. The growing number of megacities all around the world would be in chaos without metros, LRVs, and trams. Furthermore, without freight transport on rails, our highways would be even more congested than they are today.Seemingly modern technologies like electric mobility have been state of the art in railways for more than 100 years. Driverless operation has already been implemented in more than 60 metro and people mover systems around the world. But there is still need for innovation. Digitalisation is the key word, implying driverless operation for all types of railways, energy optimised driving with zero emission, automated condition based monitoring and predictive maintenance, better use of the track capacities, etc.Railway systems engineers can work for rolling stock manufacturers as well as for their consultants and suppliers. Their expertise is required by the operators as well as by the infrastructure managers. Consequently, along with the engineering companies in the private sector, the opportunities in the public sector are open to them as well.Finally, no matter where a railway systems engineer works, the diverse tasks at hand are guaranteed to be interesting, challenging, and rewarding.","The faculties of Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and the School of Business and Economics have established an interdisciplinary study programme on the field of transportation calledTransport Engineering and Mobility.The Master's programme is offered in five specialisations, covering all kinds of transportation. TheRailway Systems Engineering (RSE)Master's programmeis offered in German (""Bahnsystemingenieurwesen"") as well as in English.The RSE Master's programme is organised by the Research Center Railways, a cooperation between three institutes from the three different engineering faculties mentioned above.

The increasing influx of people can make the search for adequate accommodation quite difficult. Dozens of apartment hunters often compete for one single apartment. This is why we strongly recommend that you start looking for a place to live as soon as possible.Cologne's most convenient and economical housing option is often a student dormitory. A public student services association called ""Kölner Studierendenwerk"" (KSTW) operates 88 student dorms offering roughly 4,800 rooms. The seemingly large number of dorm rooms is misleading; as the dormitories are open to the roughly 90,000 students enrolled at all Cologne universities, they are in extremely high demand. Please be aware that TH Köln does not allocate the rooms in these dorms. Please apply directly to the KSTW:https://www.kstw.de/wohnen.You do not yet need a letter of admission in order to apply.The fierce competition on the private housing market has resulted in above-market rents – particularly in proximity of the city centre.

It aims to enable participants to promote sustainable development on an urban level in different geographical and cultural settings.The main emphasis of the Master's programme REAP lies on technology for the provision of urban and building services, yet it also investigates the socio-economic context in which these services are provided and managed.In detail, the programme:provides an overview of the complex relationships between building and urban services technology (i.e., building construction and renovation, energy and water supply, waste and waste water management) and the environment (i.e., resources and space consumption, impacts on environmental media and ecosystems)gives insight into patterns of user demand and behaviour and how they affect the technology-environment interactionimparts knowledge of resource-efficient technologies, e.g., energy generation from renewable sources, as well as underlying principles, such as source separation and the closing of material cycles, demand side management, decentralised, modularised service provision, etc.reviews experience with and conveys ideas for different forms of legal and economic organisation of planning, construction and urban services provisionteaches study and research methods and techniques for planning and decision supportWith this programme, the HCU targets people from all over the world with a wide range of academic backgrounds and work experience, sharing an interest in technology and society and a concern for urban life. As such, the programme does not require expertise in architecture or engineering nor does it award a professional degree in architecture, urban planning or civil engineering.REAP covers the following areas:SustainabilityWater, material and energy cycles in the cityResource efficient urban technologies and infrastructureEconomics and administration of buildings and urban servicesLegal and policy instrumentsUrban planning on different scales: building (1:10-1:100), neighbourhood (1:500-1: 5,000) and city (1:10,000-1:100,000) scale and regarding the specific geographical and cultural contextSkills development: dimensioning, perception, assessment and decision making in the field of sustainable resource technologiesResearch methods and decision support techniquesREAP is not:an architectural design coursefocused on a single discipline – it is interdisciplinary and follows an integrative and multidimensional planning approachThe Master's programme consists of 17 study modules taught over two academic years.","The programme consists of lectures, seminars, and project work. The lectures and seminars impart basic knowledge about sustainable development at the urban level, in particular in the fields of water/waste water, energy, and materials. They are grouped around the project work that is characteristic for the REAP programme. Projects are real-time, real-world case studies. With the help and guidance from faculty the students develop recommendations and solutions. Examples include the following: designing a building-based, integrated supply-treatment system for water and waste water; developing a plan for the environmentally sound retrofit of a housing block; and devising an incentive-based scheme for refuse management or recycling of building materials.Project work is inspired by the research activities at the university and can in turn contribute to this research. Project work allows students to explore fields that are of particular interest to them. At the same time, they can apply their practical skills and deepen their experience in developing specific concepts for (potential) real world problems. For this reason, it is advantageous for students to have relevant professional experience they can draw on for their project work. Experience with scientific work is useful, as is a general interest in environmental problems.While two-thirds of the courses are compulsory, in some areas the programme allows to choose between courses, too. However, the programme is not intended to provide a specialisation solely in energy, water or material flows, respectively, as its main intent is to provide an integrative perspective of all resource flows.Part-time studies are possible, but they are subject to restrictions for some international students.PDF Download",Yes,,,,Yes,Yes,335 EUR,"We recommend that single students budget at least 800 EUR per month to meet personal expenses (accommodation, living, health insurance, books).",Yes,https://www.hcu-hamburg.de/en/international/financial-support,"The Master of Science in Resource Efficiency in Architecture and Planning is normally open to university graduates with a Bachelor's degree or German ""Diplom"" (university or FH) or the equivalent in Architecture, Urban Planning, Geography, Landscape Planning, Civil Engineering, Law, Political Science, Business and Administration, Economics, Humanities or others with a focus on REAP-related fields and a demonstrated strong interest in interdisciplinary approaches to environmental design and technology.

While researchers once had to meticulously study the properties of a product on the basis of prototypes, they are now simulated and optimised on computers. Demands for the capabilities of numerical simulation continue to grow with the need for models that are more and more precise, the incorporation of new problem areas such as data analysis (e.g., big data) or artificial intelligence, and parameter-dependent problems and models with uncertain data. This was triggered by the relatively young and forward-looking research area of scientific computing.The field addresses the entire workflow, including modelling; mathematical, numerical, and statistical analysis; optimisation; the implementation of algorithms on high-performance computers; and the visualisation of results. However, little attention has been paid to training students in this development.The objective of the international Master’s programme is to provide a specialised range of courses that leads highly qualified, hard-working students towards the development and mathematical analysis of highly efficient numerical methods. It is a crucial point that highly complex problems are brought to a less complex numerical approximation (on parallel computers) via an understanding of their mathematical core. The Master’s programme involves – and is motivated by – several courses in other subject areas (biochemistry, physics, computer science, engineering, climate and environment), in which the simulation of demanding problems plays a crucial role. The programme is geared towards students working at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, data science, and physics. This interdisciplinary approach enables students to achieve and apply their specialised understanding of efficient methods for solving differential and integral equations and analysing large sets of data, and to extend this know-how to other subject areas.","The Master's programme is organised in elective and mandatory modules. The elective modules consist of several courses, from which the participants can choose according to their interests. They have to fulfil a certain amount of credit points in these elective modules.The following four main areas are includes in the elite Master's programme in Scientific Computing:Numerical mathematics (numerical methods for different types of differential equations, approximation methods, optimisation).Modelling and simulation of many problems from (bio)physics, (bio)computer science, chemistry, engineering sciences and climate/environmental sciencesHigh performance computing (data structures, parallel systems and algorithms)Scientific computing (complexity reduction, fast and efficient methods, mesh-free methods, data analysis, quantification of uncertainties, multiscale problems, optimisation methods in machine learning)Each year, a modelling seminar (summer semester) and a status seminar (winter semester) will be held. Students must attend two of each of these events.An industrial internship and a practical course on parallel numerical methods deepen the learned methods and algorithms.One of the modules of the programme is dedicated to key skills, such as lecture and presentation techniques, literature research, teamwork or dealing with foreign-language specialist literature. Students have to attend seminars in this module for a certain amount of time.As a conclusion of the programme, each student writes a Master's thesis on an individual research project in co-operation with industry, with international experts or under the guidance of a professor of the University of Bayreuth. For this purpose, students receive compensation for travel expenses during their research stays.At the beginning of the programme, a mentor is provided to every student. This mentor can be chosen among the involved lecturers. With the help of the mentor, the participants of the programme are able to design an individual study plan in accordance with their interests. Furthermore, the mentors act in an advisory capacity in the studies or the research interests of their students and can recommend themes for Master's theses.More details on the modules and a recommended curriculum can be found on the programme website:https://www.scientific-computing.uni-bayreuth.de/en/module-overview/index.htmlThe course organisation and the modules were created in corporation with the Elite Network of Bavaria.A brief overview of the modules can be found in the attached PDF file.PDF Download",,International guest lecturersSpecialist literature in other languagesLanguage training providedStudy tripsCourses are led with foreign partnersProjects with partners in Germany and abroad,Industrial internship,Other (e.g. state level),Yes,Yes,"In Germany, students at all higher education institutions pay a semester contribution.

Smart Energy Systems is based on the technological, economical, and ecological knowledge of distributed energy systems as well as essential digital skills. Besides the simulation and optimisation of energy systems, the focus relies on modern computer and communication technology. The use of artificial intelligence completes this interdisciplinary-orientated course of study. Our aim is to provide a deep understanding not only of the individual producer and consumer technologies but also in terms of an optimised operation of these interconnected energy systems. Job opportunities include energy suppliers or energy marketing, building technology, the automotive industry or energy-intensive industry as well as following new business ideas in founding a start-up company.The study programme offers international perspectives.German language classes can be taken as an elective module.You can find more information in thisvideo.","In the first semester, elementary technical knowledge about the components and participants of the energy system is part of the Energy Systems / Energy Economy module. Simulation of decentralised energy systems is one of a total of five digital components of the first semester, in which the interaction between the individual participants in the energy system is dealt with. In IoT Technologies and Data Interfaces, students learn how digitally networked, intelligent systems are created through sensors and Internet connections. Within LabVIEW Programming, an easy-to-learn graphic programming environment, as well as Artificial Intelligence Basics, the focus is on computer-aided problem solving and analysis. An elective course allows you to look at other exciting topics both in the first and second semester (for example, drone flying at our in-house “drone academy”).In Virtual Power Plant, the second semester deals with another essential component for the energy systems of the future, namely the merging of decentralised energy producers and the coupling of different sectors with systems for storing or otherwise using excess energy in so-called Power-to-X systems for a reliable supply. How such systems communicate securely with one another and make decisions autonomously – without any human intervention – is the subject of the AI Applications in Energy Systems / Blockchain module. Entrepreneurial thinking and acting illuminates the Energy Entrepreneurship module. Selected guest lecturers present their personal success (or even more interesting: fail) stories as entrepreneurs and encourage students to implement their own ideas, e.g. in start-ups. Optimisation / Operations Research uses the knowledge and tools from the first semester in order to be able to optimally align and operate even complex systems using simulation and mathematical optimisation. ""Hands on!"" will be the motto of the Project Course – Smart Energy System, in which the students plan, implement and present their own project – an ideal preparation for later professional life.The third semester allows you to deepen your knowledge on selected topics as part of the Master's thesis, which is planned in cooperation with various companies. The Scientific Work Master's Seminar accompanies the Master's thesis, opens up the exchange between the students in the form of lectures and provides the tools for a solid scientific approach.You will complete the Master’s degree in three semesters.

As a result, the water-energy nexus, which reaches across various sectors, is becoming increasingly important. Knowing the relationship between water and energy supply and distribution (both pillars in sustainability), it is necessary to connect different scientific perspectives. By considering complex interdependencies – detached from individual resources – the water-energy nexus gains importance as a key element of sustainable development.By offering the Master's course of study in Sustainable Management, RWTH Aachen University is meeting the demand for interdisciplinary collaboration. The programme integrates disciplines from energy, civil, and environmental engineering; geography; business and economics; and the social sciences. Students gain specialised analysis, method, solution, and evaluation skills in the fields of water and energy management. Furthermore, the course of study teaches interdisciplinary skills, such as the ability to critically reflect on innovations in a global context and the ability to work and research independently.This technical breadth will allow graduates to face complex and global challenges in their professional lives that are scientifically, technologically, and socially relevant. The programme aims at qualifying a new generation of socially responsible engineers who will contribute to shaping global, sustainable development.","Students' interdisciplinary perspectives are carefully crafted from the first to the last semester. The programme begins with interdisciplinary units and then transitions to water and water management (at RWTH Aachen University). Next, it moves on to the field of energy and energy management (mandatory mobility window abroad at Politecnico di Milano), and it ends with a final semester dedicated to the water-energy nexus (at RWTH Aachen University).

It is applied to urban systems and spaces from district to regional level. The Urban Design programme deals with urbanisation processes in an international context and covers both historical and current developments.The Master's course of study is aimed at students from different disciplines who wish to prepare for a career in a creative and scientific field of work, or who seek a key role in urban planning and public administration. The objective is to develop the skills of critical research-design: creative solutions for contemporary urban problems need to be scientifically sound and justified and to take into account the cultural, social and political conditions.Architects and planners often find that their knowledge and skills alone are insufficient for coping with the challenges and tasks involved in modern urbanisation processes. Urban design is an inter- and transdisciplinary field of knowledge at the interface of architecture, urban and regional planning, urban sociology, landscape architecture and environmental planning. This programme aims at the development and sharing of integrated knowledge. A wide range of courses provides access to the various disciplines. In addition, the interdisciplinary nature of urban design is reflected in the high level of student teamwork and exchanges in the context of design projects, the so-called labs and studios. Above all, methodologies are practised that reveal the high degree of complexity of tasks and enable the students to intervene in diverse contexts.In cooperation with Tongji University in Shanghai, China, the Urban Design course of study is also offered as a dual degree Master's programme. Participants will spend the first year of study in Berlin and the second year in Shanghai.","The Urban Design course of study is a consecutive Master's degree programme. Students who successfully complete the programme will be conferred the degree of “Master of Science in Urban Design"". The standard period of study, including the Master's thesis, is four semesters. The study programme comprises 120 credit points (CP) after the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS). The language of instruction is English.Compulsory CoursesUrban Design ProjectsThe scientifically-grounded projects are practical problem-based assignments that approach current planning and design tasks holistically at the local, regional, national and international level.The projects formulate complex tasks on the basis of specific urban development problems, through which a comprehensive urban design process can be trained as an example. These processes range from the systematic analysis of urban planning and the preparation and discussion of alternative usage and structure programmes and design concepts to exemplary design studies of the individual elements (exterior, building typology, transport, etc.) of an overall urban design.Urban Design Methods and ToolsThe Urban Design Methods and Tools module focuses on the scientific methods employed in the Master's disciplines of architecture, urban and regional planning, landscape architecture and sociology and on possible ways of integrating these disciplines. The two modular parts are composed of sequences of methodological and theoretical input alternating with practical examples and exercises. The aim is to illustrate the interdisciplinary nature of urban design in research and practice. Critical design approaches and spatial research (i.e. research by design) will be discussed.Introduction to Urban DesignThis module focuses on planning and creative tasks that take into account the social context. Students will acquire in-depth knowledge of the history of urbanism and of the impact of social and societal structures on the image of cities and how they work. The module also provides insights into the political, economic, social and cultural conditions of urban planning processes at the national and international level. Students will develop thesis-related questions and issues according to the criteria of scientific and artistic work. They will strengthen their critical reflection skills in relation to urbanisation processes and their influencing factors. Students will learn systematic work on a topic through theoretical and analytical approaches and their textual, conceptual and design editing and specification.Master's Thesis ColloquiumIn the Master's thesis colloquium, students will learn how to do scientific and artistic work in theory and practice in order to prepare for the Master's thesis.Compulsory Optional CoursesStudents may choose compulsory optional modules from the catalogue in the Urban Design handbook. The available modules are comprised of four urban design relevant offers from the Master’s courses in architecture, urban and regional planning, landscape architecture and sociology.Optional CoursesOptional courses may be selected from the entire curriculum of TU Berlin.PDF Download",Yes,International guest lecturersStudy tripsProjects with partners in Germany and abroadInternational comparisons and thematic reference to the international contextContent-related regional focus,,DAAD,No,No,https://www.tu.berlin/en/studierendensekretariat/topics-a-z/semester-fees,,No,,"A condition for admission to Urban Design is a Bachelor’s degree or equivalent diploma in architecture, urban and regional planning, landscape architecture or a closely related field of study.

We also recommend applying as early as possible.,None,No,No,"BackgroundUrban areas in advanced economies face major spatial challenges with a long lasting impact on cities. The drivers for urban transformation are manifold and include technological change and digitalisation, migration and demographic shifts, climate change, and increasing relevance of agglomeration economies as well as post- and re-industrialisation.Spatial implications of structural change and the organisation of such transformation demand for deliberate strategies to revitalise the traditional manufacturing cores. These include a wide range of new forms of interventions such as social innovation, governance, resilience, urban laboratories and urban strategy.Why Dortmund?Given its geographical location in the Ruhr, the Urban Transformation Master's programme benefits from the extensive experience in the region. The Ruhr has become a touted model for transition regions, and it serves as a laboratory with excellent opportunities to learn about the challenges as well as strategies of transforming and revitalising post-industrial locations. The IBA Emscher Park strategy (1989-1999) is known worldwide as a particularly innovative planning practice. The unique strategy of re-imaging and revitalising the industrial landscape has raised considerable interest among planners and policy makers.The spatial implications of structural change and the ongoing transformation of the Ruhr have always influenced academic debates as well as research. Complementing the local experience, international examples are also integrated into the programme. These enable our students to identify similarities as well as differences on a local, national and global scale.Aimof the Master’s ProgrammeThe one-year MSc programme at the Dortmund School of Planning aims to attract highly qualified students who wish to learn more about innovative strategies to transform cities and regions at a location offering brilliant in situ conditions where students can gain an understanding of the complexity of governance and planning. The programme builds upon a Bachelor's programme in spatial planning, as established at our school. The philosophy of the Master's programme is based on the understanding of planning as a multidisciplinary discipline. The course and projects in the programme seek to bridge international theories of structural change and spatial transformation with the practice of governance in cities and regions.","MODULE 1:Lecture – ungraded essay (2 CP)""Ruhrlecture"": discussing urban transformation theories with a global perspective with international guestsSeminar – graded presentation and term paper (6 CP)""Ruhrseminar"": discussing structural change and spatial development in advanced urban economiesMODULE 2:Selection of one graded Master's project or Urban Design Studio (12 CP) with up to five other studentsMODULE 3:Selection of two graded (6 CP each) and two ungraded seminars (4 CP each)The seminars are as follows:European Experiences in Transformation Processes: Cases and PoliciesPost-Industrial Regions as Laboratories of Structural ChangeStrategic Urban Development in Shrinking Cities and RegionsLegacy Cities in the Northern HemisphereUrban Regeneration: Theories and PrinciplesTopics in Urban EconomicsMODULE 4:Master’s thesis (20 CP)",Yes,International comparisons and thematic reference to the international context,,,No,Yes,"TU Dortmund University is a public institution.
