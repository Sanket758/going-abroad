       "  'Description/content': 'Students gain broad knowledge of design and construction through a combination of lecture series and modules that discuss design and construction in the areas of urban design, design of buildings in existing contexts and built environments, and design of new buildings. These topics are directly related to internationally oriented projects and a series of elective modules, giving students the chance to focus on their individual interests, which may then become the main focus of their Master’s theses. Moreover, 30 ECTS can be chosen from the German Master’s degree programme in “Design and Construction“ (“Entwurf und Konstruktion”).By intensively studying several contexts from a global, diversity-oriented, and multicultural point of view, students develop an ability to independently translate any abstract design into a concrete implementation of material and construction. They will be able to combine professional, practical, technical, economic, ecological, and social aspects while, at the same time, taking varied cultural, historical, and climatic situations into consideration.In the fourth semester, students write their Master’s theses.The modules complement each other and are linked to one another, for instance, through combined projects, excursions, lectures, conferences, and e-learning. The integrated, international structure of the degree course offers students the chance to have a unique study experience in the future-oriented metropolis of Frankfurt.Course objectivesThe study programme concentrates on the combination of design and construction. “Advanced Architecture“ means designing and constructing on all scales, from urban contexts to single details. Advanced, future-oriented concepts are developed and addressed in study projects and office internships as well as with the FFin (the Frankfurt University research institute) and in close collaboration with our cooperation partners from the construction sector.In particular, graduates will be able to work at the interface between abstract designs and their concrete implementations. This means a focus on the planning phase, referred to in the German Official Scale of Fees for Services by Architects and Engineers as “execution planning“, with strong feedback on the design process and in close connection with current developments of scientific research in design and construction.Relevant occupational fields of graduates are in architectural, engineering, and construction companies, the construction industry, property development and housing associations, real estate companies, and the public sector as well as the research and technological development of design and construction.',\n",
       "  'Course organisation': 'The full-time English Master’s degree programme in “Advanced Architecture. From Urban Design to Building Construction” lasts for four semesters and operates in close conjunction with the existing German Master’s degree programme in “Design and Construction\". During their two years of study, students will acquire 120 ECTS credits and will be awarded the academic degree of Master of Science (MSc).The degree course is aimed at graduates with a first academic degree in architecture from European and non-European countries who want to focus on architecture in an international context. The Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences cooperates with the Frankfurt Research Institute (Frankfurter Forschungsinstitut FFin) and a specific architectural trainee programme called TRAX to offer special on-site opportunities to students. Students can get involved in ongoing research projects in order to learn and develop scientific work through application-oriented research in the field of design and construction, or they can learn the actual implementation of concepts in practice.The study programme complies with the UIA standards (Union of International Architects). It\\xa0provides a prerequisite for entry into the German Chamber of Architects.First semesterStarting with the 2024 summer semester, five modules will be offered: Lecture Series Design (5 ECTS), Urban Contexts — Design and Construction (10 ECTS), International Design and Build Project (5\\xa0ECTS), Impromptu Designs (5 ECTS), and one elective course (5 ECTS).The elective course\\xa0can be chosen from a pool of seven courses offered in English, including the following courses: Climate Design; Rehabilitate, Reuse, Add-On; Urban Design and Public Space; Urban Renewal and Redevelopment; Digital Basics; and Construction, Material, and Experimental Design. The elective courses may also be chosen from fifteen further courses from the closely related \"Entwurf und Konstruktion” German Master\\'s programme, which is offered in German.Second semesterFive modules are offered: Lecture Series Construction (5 ECTS), New Buildings — Design and Construction (10 ECTS), International Design Project (5 ECTS), and two elective courses (each with 5 ECTS).Third semesterFour modules are offered: Existing Contexts — Design and Construction (10 ECTS), specialisation project (10 ECTS), and two more elective courses (each with 5 ECTS).Fourth semesterMaster\\'s thesis and colloquium (30 ECTS)PDF Download',\n",
