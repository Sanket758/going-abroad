How can transport networks be logically developed, expanded, relieved, and ecologically planned? How can factors like rolling stock and routing be managed in a way that need-oriented and smooth railway traffic is possible? How do random disturbances in transportation have to be considered in order to avoid jamming or to optimise safety strategies? How can we shift more passenger and freight transport to the rails? Is driverless operation possible for all kinds of rail transport means? When the interaction of technical possibilities, infrastructure, and human behaviour is supposed to be optimised, transport engineers are called upon for their interdisciplinary perspective.Students of the Railway Systems Engineering programme acquire this interdisciplinary expertise by studying the perspectives of three engineering disciplines: civil engineering, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering. The specialisation Railway Systems Engineering (RSE) concentrates on the further development of railway engineering. Students work with rail vehicles, rail transportation systems, and infrastructure developments in rail transportation. This Master's programme covers each aspect of the complete system of ""railway"": the infrastructure, operation, and vehicles, including the electrical drive as well as electric power supply. Furthermore, this is the only specialisation of the Master's degree programme in Transport Engineering and Mobility that can be studied completely in English.Course objectives and future opportunitiesThe objective of this specialisation is to train and educate engineers with multidisciplinary expertise that can take the challenges of the modern railway sector head on. The future possibilities for railways, the eldest of the modern transport means, are the brightest among all others. Railways remain ecologically superior, even as modern high-speed trains compete successfully with short and medium distance aeroplanes. The growing number of megacities all around the world would be in chaos without metros, LRVs, and trams. Furthermore, without freight transport on rails, our highways would be even more congested than they are today.Seemingly modern technologies like electric mobility have been state of the art in railways for more than 100 years. Driverless operation has already been implemented in more than 60 metro and people mover systems around the world. But there is still need for innovation. Digitalisation is the key word, implying driverless operation for all types of railways, energy optimised driving with zero emission, automated condition based monitoring and predictive maintenance, better use of the track capacities, etc.Railway systems engineers can work for rolling stock manufacturers as well as for their consultants and suppliers. Their expertise is required by the operators as well as by the infrastructure managers. Consequently, along with the engineering companies in the private sector, the opportunities in the public sector are open to them as well.Finally, no matter where a railway systems engineer works, the diverse tasks at hand are guaranteed to be interesting, challenging, and rewarding.","The faculties of Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and the School of Business and Economics have established an interdisciplinary study programme on the field of transportation calledTransport Engineering and Mobility.The Master's programme is offered in five specialisations, covering all kinds of transportation.

It aims to enable participants to promote sustainable development on an urban level in different geographical and cultural settings.The main emphasis of the Master's programme REAP lies on technology for the provision of urban and building services, yet it also investigates the socio-economic context in which these services are provided and managed.In detail, the programme:provides an overview of the complex relationships between building and urban services technology (i.e., building construction and renovation, energy and water supply, waste and waste water management) and the environment (i.e., resources and space consumption, impacts on environmental media and ecosystems)gives insight into patterns of user demand and behaviour and how they affect the technology-environment interactionimparts knowledge of resource-efficient technologies, e.g., energy generation from renewable sources, as well as underlying principles, such as source separation and the closing of material cycles, demand side management, decentralised, modularised service provision, etc.reviews experience with and conveys ideas for different forms of legal and economic organisation of planning, construction and urban services provisionteaches study and research methods and techniques for planning and decision supportWith this programme, the HCU targets people from all over the world with a wide range of academic backgrounds and work experience, sharing an interest in technology and society and a concern for urban life. As such, the programme does not require expertise in architecture or engineering nor does it award a professional degree in architecture, urban planning or civil engineering.REAP covers the following areas:SustainabilityWater, material and energy cycles in the cityResource efficient urban technologies and infrastructureEconomics and administration of buildings and urban servicesLegal and policy instrumentsUrban planning on different scales: building (1:10-1:100), neighbourhood (1:500-1: 5,000) and city (1:10,000-1:100,000) scale and regarding the specific geographical and cultural contextSkills development: dimensioning, perception, assessment and decision making in the field of sustainable resource technologiesResearch methods and decision support techniquesREAP is not:an architectural design coursefocused on a single discipline – it is interdisciplinary and follows an integrative and multidimensional planning approachThe Master's programme consists of 17 study modules taught over two academic years.","The programme consists of lectures, seminars, and project work. The lectures and seminars impart basic knowledge about sustainable development at the urban level, in particular in the fields of water/waste water, energy, and materials. They are grouped around the project work that is characteristic for the REAP programme. Projects are real-time, real-world case studies. With the help and guidance from faculty the students develop recommendations and solutions. Examples include the following: designing a building-based, integrated supply-treatment system for water and waste water; developing a plan for the environmentally sound retrofit of a housing block; and devising an incentive-based scheme for refuse management or recycling of building materials.Project work is inspired by the research activities at the university and can in turn contribute to this research. Project work allows students to explore fields that are of particular interest to them. At the same time, they can apply their practical skills and deepen their experience in developing specific concepts for (potential) real world problems. For this reason, it is advantageous for students to have relevant professional experience they can draw on for their project work. Experience with scientific work is useful, as is a general interest in environmental problems.While two-thirds of the courses are compulsory, in some areas the programme allows to choose between courses, too.

While researchers once had to meticulously study the properties of a product on the basis of prototypes, they are now simulated and optimised on computers. Demands for the capabilities of numerical simulation continue to grow with the need for models that are more and more precise, the incorporation of new problem areas such as data analysis (e.g., big data) or artificial intelligence, and parameter-dependent problems and models with uncertain data. This was triggered by the relatively young and forward-looking research area of scientific computing.The field addresses the entire workflow, including modelling; mathematical, numerical, and statistical analysis; optimisation; the implementation of algorithms on high-performance computers; and the visualisation of results. However, little attention has been paid to training students in this development.The objective of the international Master’s programme is to provide a specialised range of courses that leads highly qualified, hard-working students towards the development and mathematical analysis of highly efficient numerical methods. It is a crucial point that highly complex problems are brought to a less complex numerical approximation (on parallel computers) via an understanding of their mathematical core. The Master’s programme involves – and is motivated by – several courses in other subject areas (biochemistry, physics, computer science, engineering, climate and environment), in which the simulation of demanding problems plays a crucial role. The programme is geared towards students working at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, data science, and physics. This interdisciplinary approach enables students to achieve and apply their specialised understanding of efficient methods for solving differential and integral equations and analysing large sets of data, and to extend this know-how to other subject areas.","The Master's programme is organised in elective and mandatory modules. The elective modules consist of several courses, from which the participants can choose according to their interests. They have to fulfil a certain amount of credit points in these elective modules.The following four main areas are includes in the elite Master's programme in Scientific Computing:Numerical mathematics (numerical methods for different types of differential equations, approximation methods, optimisation).Modelling and simulation of many problems from (bio)physics, (bio)computer science, chemistry, engineering sciences and climate/environmental sciencesHigh performance computing (data structures, parallel systems and algorithms)Scientific computing (complexity reduction, fast and efficient methods, mesh-free methods, data analysis, quantification of uncertainties, multiscale problems, optimisation methods in machine learning)Each year, a modelling seminar (summer semester) and a status seminar (winter semester) will be held. Students must attend two of each of these events.An industrial internship and a practical course on parallel numerical methods deepen the learned methods and algorithms.One of the modules of the programme is dedicated to key skills, such as lecture and presentation techniques, literature research, teamwork or dealing with foreign-language specialist literature. Students have to attend seminars in this module for a certain amount of time.As a conclusion of the programme, each student writes a Master's thesis on an individual research project in co-operation with industry, with international experts or under the guidance of a professor of the University of Bayreuth. For this purpose, students receive compensation for travel expenses during their research stays.At the beginning of the programme, a mentor is provided to every student. This mentor can be chosen among the involved lecturers. With the help of the mentor, the participants of the programme are able to design an individual study plan in accordance with their interests. Furthermore, the mentors act in an advisory capacity in the studies or the research interests of their students and can recommend themes for Master's theses.More details on the modules and a recommended curriculum can be found on the programme website:https://www.scientific-computing.uni-bayreuth.de/en/module-overview/index.htmlThe course organisation and the modules were created in corporation with the Elite Network of Bavaria.A brief overview of the modules can be found in the attached PDF file.PDF Download",,International guest lecturersSpecialist literature in other languagesLanguage training providedStudy tripsCourses are led with foreign partnersProjects with partners in Germany and abroad,Industrial internship,Yes,Yes,"In Germany, students at all higher education institutions pay a semester contribution.

Smart Energy Systems is based on the technological, economical, and ecological knowledge of distributed energy systems as well as essential digital skills. Besides the simulation and optimisation of energy systems, the focus relies on modern computer and communication technology. The use of artificial intelligence completes this interdisciplinary-orientated course of study. Our aim is to provide a deep understanding not only of the individual producer and consumer technologies but also in terms of an optimised operation of these interconnected energy systems. Job opportunities include energy suppliers or energy marketing, building technology, the automotive industry or energy-intensive industry as well as following new business ideas in founding a start-up company.The study programme offers international perspectives.German language classes can be taken as an elective module.You can find more information in thisvideo.","In the first semester, elementary technical knowledge about the components and participants of the energy system is part of the Energy Systems / Energy Economy module. Simulation of decentralised energy systems is one of a total of five digital components of the first semester, in which the interaction between the individual participants in the energy system is dealt with. In IoT Technologies and Data Interfaces, students learn how digitally networked, intelligent systems are created through sensors and Internet connections. Within LabVIEW Programming, an easy-to-learn graphic programming environment, as well as Artificial Intelligence Basics, the focus is on computer-aided problem solving and analysis. An elective course allows you to look at other exciting topics both in the first and second semester (for example, drone flying at our in-house “drone academy”).In Virtual Power Plant, the second semester deals with another essential component for the energy systems of the future, namely the merging of decentralised energy producers and the coupling of different sectors with systems for storing or otherwise using excess energy in so-called Power-to-X systems for a reliable supply. How such systems communicate securely with one another and make decisions autonomously – without any human intervention – is the subject of the AI Applications in Energy Systems / Blockchain module. Entrepreneurial thinking and acting illuminates the Energy Entrepreneurship module. Selected guest lecturers present their personal success (or even more interesting: fail) stories as entrepreneurs and encourage students to implement their own ideas, e.g. in start-ups. Optimisation / Operations Research uses the knowledge and tools from the first semester in order to be able to optimally align and operate even complex systems using simulation and mathematical optimisation. ""Hands on!"" will be the motto of the Project Course – Smart Energy System, in which the students plan, implement and present their own project – an ideal preparation for later professional life.The third semester allows you to deepen your knowledge on selected topics as part of the Master's thesis, which is planned in cooperation with various companies.

In addition, the interdisciplinary nature of urban design is reflected in the high level of student teamwork and exchanges in the context of design projects, the so-called labs and studios. Above all, methodologies are practised that reveal the high degree of complexity of tasks and enable the students to intervene in diverse contexts.In cooperation with Tongji University in Shanghai, China, the Urban Design course of study is also offered as a dual degree Master's programme. Participants will spend the first year of study in Berlin and the second year in Shanghai.","The Urban Design course of study is a consecutive Master's degree programme. Students who successfully complete the programme will be conferred the degree of “Master of Science in Urban Design"". The standard period of study, including the Master's thesis, is four semesters. The study programme comprises 120 credit points (CP) after the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS). The language of instruction is English.Compulsory CoursesUrban Design ProjectsThe scientifically-grounded projects are practical problem-based assignments that approach current planning and design tasks holistically at the local, regional, national and international level.The projects formulate complex tasks on the basis of specific urban development problems, through which a comprehensive urban design process can be trained as an example. These processes range from the systematic analysis of urban planning and the preparation and discussion of alternative usage and structure programmes and design concepts to exemplary design studies of the individual elements (exterior, building typology, transport, etc.) of an overall urban design.Urban Design Methods and ToolsThe Urban Design Methods and Tools module focuses on the scientific methods employed in the Master's disciplines of architecture, urban and regional planning, landscape architecture and sociology and on possible ways of integrating these disciplines. The two modular parts are composed of sequences of methodological and theoretical input alternating with practical examples and exercises. The aim is to illustrate the interdisciplinary nature of urban design in research and practice. Critical design approaches and spatial research (i.e. research by design) will be discussed.Introduction to Urban DesignThis module focuses on planning and creative tasks that take into account the social context. Students will acquire in-depth knowledge of the history of urbanism and of the impact of social and societal structures on the image of cities and how they work. The module also provides insights into the political, economic, social and cultural conditions of urban planning processes at the national and international level. Students will develop thesis-related questions and issues according to the criteria of scientific and artistic work. They will strengthen their critical reflection skills in relation to urbanisation processes and their influencing factors. Students will learn systematic work on a topic through theoretical and analytical approaches and their textual, conceptual and design editing and specification.Master's Thesis ColloquiumIn the Master's thesis colloquium, students will learn how to do scientific and artistic work in theory and practice in order to prepare for the Master's thesis.Compulsory Optional CoursesStudents may choose compulsory optional modules from the catalogue in the Urban Design handbook. The available modules are comprised of four urban design relevant offers from the Master’s courses in architecture, urban and regional planning, landscape architecture and sociology.Optional CoursesOptional courses may be selected from the entire curriculum of TU Berlin.PDF Download",Yes,International guest lecturersStudy tripsProjects with partners in Germany and abroadInternational comparisons and thematic reference to the international contextContent-related regional focus,,No,No,https://www.tu.berlin/en/studierendensekretariat/topics-a-z/semester-fees,,No,,"A condition for admission to Urban Design is a Bachelor’s degree or equivalent diploma in architecture, urban and regional planning, landscape architecture or a closely related field of study.

We also recommend applying as early as possible.,None,No,No,"BackgroundUrban areas in advanced economies face major spatial challenges with a long lasting impact on cities. The drivers for urban transformation are manifold and include technological change and digitalisation, migration and demographic shifts, climate change, and increasing relevance of agglomeration economies as well as post- and re-industrialisation.Spatial implications of structural change and the organisation of such transformation demand for deliberate strategies to revitalise the traditional manufacturing cores. These include a wide range of new forms of interventions such as social innovation, governance, resilience, urban laboratories and urban strategy.Why Dortmund?Given its geographical location in the Ruhr, the Urban Transformation Master's programme benefits from the extensive experience in the region. The Ruhr has become a touted model for transition regions, and it serves as a laboratory with excellent opportunities to learn about the challenges as well as strategies of transforming and revitalising post-industrial locations. The IBA Emscher Park strategy (1989-1999) is known worldwide as a particularly innovative planning practice. The unique strategy of re-imaging and revitalising the industrial landscape has raised considerable interest among planners and policy makers.The spatial implications of structural change and the ongoing transformation of the Ruhr have always influenced academic debates as well as research. Complementing the local experience, international examples are also integrated into the programme. These enable our students to identify similarities as well as differences on a local, national and global scale.Aimof the Master’s ProgrammeThe one-year MSc programme at the Dortmund School of Planning aims to attract highly qualified students who wish to learn more about innovative strategies to transform cities and regions at a location offering brilliant in situ conditions where students can gain an understanding of the complexity of governance and planning. The programme builds upon a Bachelor's programme in spatial planning, as established at our school. The philosophy of the Master's programme is based on the understanding of planning as a multidisciplinary discipline. The course and projects in the programme seek to bridge international theories of structural change and spatial transformation with the practice of governance in cities and regions.","MODULE 1:Lecture – ungraded essay (2 CP)""Ruhrlecture"": discussing urban transformation theories with a global perspective with international guestsSeminar – graded presentation and term paper (6 CP)""Ruhrseminar"": discussing structural change and spatial development in advanced urban economiesMODULE 2:Selection of one graded Master's project or Urban Design Studio (12 CP) with up to five other studentsMODULE 3:Selection of two graded (6 CP each) and two ungraded seminars (4 CP each)The seminars are as follows:European Experiences in Transformation Processes: Cases and PoliciesPost-Industrial Regions as Laboratories of Structural ChangeStrategic Urban Development in Shrinking Cities and RegionsLegacy Cities in the Northern HemisphereUrban Regeneration: Theories and PrinciplesTopics in Urban EconomicsMODULE 4:Master’s thesis (20 CP)",Yes,International comparisons and thematic reference to the international context,,No,Yes,"TU Dortmund University is a public institution.
